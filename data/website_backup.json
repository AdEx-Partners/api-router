EAM meets the information needs of IT and business stakeholders alike and positively impacts finance, IT security, operations and decision making. It promotes growth, reduces complexity, and gives IT executives transparent and comprehensive insight into the IT architecture. EAM enables the targeted assignment of responsibilities to stakeholders and provides a clear roadmap for digital transformation.\nHowever, as with any major initiative, potential challenges can arise when implementing EAM, especially in the early stages.\nAt AdEx Partners, we have a structured process for successful strategy development and execution through analysis, design, planning and implementation. We do this by leveraging proven architectural principles and practices and guiding your business through any necessary changes.\nOur approach reduces complexity by promoting global technology standards, resulting in secure and efficient solutions. Our expertise spans the entire IT service stack and places special emphasis on methodologies, policies and governance."

Today, the required data is generated everywhere, and the responsibility for its collection and provision must be established in the company. However, the enormous amount of data is also a challenge. To obtain the right information, it must be prepared, qualified and analyzed. If the right conclusions can be drawn from the data, they offer the potential to transform the entire company and create new value-adding business models.\nData Quality Management & Data Analytics\nThe value of the data is also based on its quality. Whether master data for your ERP or the analysis of your customer data based on Big Data:\nHigh data quality is necessary to achieve the highest possible added value\n. The establishment of a data quality management system creates the basis for sustainably high data quality. With the involvement of the right employees, processes, and technologies, the information that is relevant and decisive for action can be specifically compiled and enriched from the mass of incoming data. The construction of a well-thought-out, interlocking, and target-oriented\ndata lifecycle provides the framework for obtaining valuable results from the data\n.\nData Security & Privacy Strategy\nData as a basis for new business models and thus for further competitive advantages, represent an immense value. The protection of data and privacy is not only required by law but should be seen as\nsafeguarding the value of the company\n.

      "text": "Our Story\n2012\nAdEx Partners was formally founded on\nMarch 6, 2012\nwith the entry in the Hamburg Commercial Register. The AdEx story began with the vision of becoming a\n“Trusted Advisor”\nfor companies and supporting our clients with an experienced and highly qualified team in the management of complex, global and forward-looking projects.\n2013\nIn spring 2013, the\nfirst employees\nwere hired, and by the end of 2013 there were seven employees. By the way, the name of the company came from\nAd\nvisory\nEx\ncellence! The business idea was confirmed by a turnover of almost one million euros in the first business year.\n2014\nBy the end of 2014, we already had\n20 highly qualified people\nin the AdEx team. At the same time, we at AdEx Partners saw ourselves as a partnership in the classic sense from the very beginning and we have remained so to this day. Teamwork, mutual support and networking has become the key to AdEx Partners’ success. We have never lost sight of our quality standards.\n2015\nWe have lost nothing of our start-up character. However, we are continuing to professionalise our internal processes and are\nstarting to rent office space\nand build up our back office. In addition, divisions such as the “Marketing & Communications” team are being created.\n2016\nIn 2016, we are already successfully involved in projects for 40 different clients. For this purpose, we are now represented with\nlocal offices in Germany, Austria and Switzerland\nand plan to expand into other European countries in the medium term.\n2017\nOn 6 March 2017, we celebrate our 5th birthday. With a team of now more than\n80 permanent and freelance employees\n, we provide our clients with excellent quality, which we want to continue to increase. In addition to location-based expansion, another focus is on opening up additional industries, such as the financial services and insurance sectors.\n2018\nThis year we also specialise in IT and technology-related areas and\nfound AdEx Solutions\n. The focus here is clearly on topics such as cloud and technical workplaces. We are also positioning ourselves more and more in the area of\ncorporate social responsibility\nand are involved in the digitalisation of food rescue and distribution at the Tafel.\n2019\nFrom the beginning, AdEx Partners has been\na participatory company\n. Despite increasing size, we want to continue to offer our employees a home and maintain a family-like approach to each other. To this end, we are developing and implementing the\n“Hood Concept” in 2019\n. We are also launching the Social Bootcamp this year, with which we are successfully implementing the\nSkilled Volunteering approach\nof AdEx Corporate Responsibility.\n2020\nCORONA – does it really have any place in our corporate history?\nWe think so: the pandemic is also changing our everyday working life drastically. Together, we are preparing for the new circumstances and are well prepared from the start. After all, we can still celebrate a great\nkick-off in Hamburg\nat the beginning of 2020, where our new website will also be presented. Another highlight is that we will be named a\n“Hidden Champion”\nof the consulting industry for the first time this year.\n2021\nThe pandemic continues to keep us on our toes. Remarkable: Despite the difficult, completely changed circumstances, we are able to achieve excellent business results and\ncontinue to grow both in turnover, profit and in our staff numbers\n. We experience the excellent AdEx Partners spirit, thank God, once again at one of our summer festivals in Warnemünde.\n2022\nOn March 6, 2022\nwe celebrate 10 years of AdEx Partners!\nWe have not lost any of our spirit. We now have more than 170 employees and look back on the last 10 years with pride. We are ready for the challenges. Beginning last year, we have jointly defined our company purpose:\n“Empowering leading organisations to shape the digital future of Europe”\n.\n2023\nOur vision and mission:\nTrusted Leader of Business Transformation\nby leading and catalyzing tailor-made transformations based on deep relationships!\nOur clients see us as leaders and partners of choice to successfully shape their transformation together. We are Trusted Advisors – we empower and inspire our clients in their transformation to achieve their strategic goals. Business transformation means for us fundamental changes in all dimensions of value creation of companies and organizations. We understand the term holistically, meaning it encompasses all aspects of our clients’ business, including IT, and we aim to support our clients in all areas. To achieve our vision, we need the best team with the right skillset. Together with our strategic partner Capvis, we are able to drive our growth while remaining an independent trusted advisor to our customers."

      "text": "Building future-proof IT landscapes\nThe ability to react directly and purposefully to changes and to adapt is increasingly becoming a substantial success factor. The central pivot for digitalised, future-proof business structures is IT. While IT used to be more of an operational service unit with a focus on the reliable provision of IT services,\nit is now increasingly developing into an integral part of the value creation of companies.\nDigital platforms, digitalisation of products and service offerings and, last but not least, the dependence of efficient business and customer processes on information and technology make IT a core factor of corporate success.\nThe transformation of IT is therefore much more than just answering the question of how new technologies can be integrated into existing architectures. New methods are necessary and must be lived, learned and experienced in the company. Existing working models have to be rethought in the context of the merging of IT and business units. Agile end-customer-focused development, continuous change (CI/CD), adaptive scaling using hyperscalers, securing digital security and the comprehensive transformation of the IT operating model to a product-oriented set-up and shared value streams with the business units are just some of the challenges that modern IT organisations have to overcome. And not to forget: the employees. They shape the change, have to understand it and support it.\nMeeting the high speed of change with automation and disruption\nIT transformations are complex. Changes usually affect all business areas and influence the competitiveness of the company. Establishing technological disruption and the adaptation of internal IT to be able to react to current, foreseeable and as yet unknown requirements as an ongoing process is the main requirement for corresponding transformation projects. Basically,\nit is a matter of understanding IT as an inherent part of value creation and setting it up to be capable of change\nin such a way that it is the driver of the digital transformation of the entire company.\nChanges in the IT organisation are often made selectively and without an overall view of the company – in many cases they do not lead to the desired result. Unaware of its capabilities and the increasing business requirements, IT is not managed in a targeted manner. This results in services that are considered insufficient or unsupportive by the business departments.\nWith our experience from numerous transformation projects, extensive technology knowledge and pragmatic approach, we support you from defining the new strategic direction to implementation. Without any commitment to specific technology providers, we stand by your side as a neutral advisor; our only commitment is your success.\nTogether with you, we will achieve this – and even more:\nConducting an IT assessment to create the necessary transparency (such as, among other things, identifying potential for value enhancement, evaluating IT process maturity and IT performance, reviewing the application and infrastructure landscape, reviewing the project portfolio in relation to business needs, assessing whether the future requirements of the business units can be met by IT, etc.).\nDevelopment of a new operating model for new products, services or market appearances\nStandardisation, automation and harmonisation of your organisation"

Integrating these elements across different platforms, business units, and partners can enhance efficiency and decision-making.\n2\nLeveraging GenAI for Integration\nBy adopting robust GenAI models, enterprises can address current limitations such as context window size, compute power constraints, and energy consumption. Smart integration and orchestration of these models can drive significant improvements in operational efficiency and innovation.\n3\nCustom Solutions for Unique Landscapes\nUnlike Apple, enterprises often operate within a complex and heterogeneous IT landscape. This includes a historical array of platforms, structures, and architectures for data and integrations, varying by division and geography. Tailored solutions are essential to navigate this complexity and achieve seamless integration.\n4\nPlatform Diversity Management\nEven when focusing on major platforms like SAP and Salesforce, custom solutions and cross-ecosystem integrations will differ significantly. Enterprises must manage critical information, such as customer master data, which is often scattered across numerous applications."

As individual as companies, the problem and the goal are, transformations also require individual and specific designs, management and drive. ​\nClearly there is not “the one and only” method that guarantees a successful transformation. However, the enabler are dedicated people, experienced and capable to compose a transformation roadmap as individually as the organization, its problem and aim are. ​\n​There is no transformation for its own sake. There must be a business reason, a problem to overcome, an aim to reach to start any transformation. Without that a transformation has no purpose, thus no success, and no end. ​\nMerger & Acquisition, new business model innovation, become more agile or increase digital capabilities are business reasons to start a transformation. ​\nTo close a Transformation as soon as a stable state is reached, is as important as the initiation of the transformation.​\nWe are happy to discuss our believe for transformations to lead to a stable state, an end. There is no need and no meaning to an endless, forever ongoing transformation. Our understanding of transformation does not include the great capability of continuous improvements."

At the same time, there is a growing need for companies to be able to act more efficiently, transparently, flexible and integrated. In its basic function, an ERP used to manage all necessary information about resources such as material, personnel, capacities or finances; however, the\nnew challenges for an ERP\nlie in transforming this\ninformation into recommendations for action for the user, taking into account the current context\n(market situation, customer interaction, priorities, etc.) to support better, data-based decision-making.\nCompeting priorities and metrics of different business areas and processes need to be revised and finally subordinate themselves to the goal of “fulfilled customer expectations”. Only by connecting and implementing\nstrategic processes and associated capabilities across business units,\ncan the associated ERP landscape deliver a value-enhancing contribution to improving market position and competitiveness.\nAn ERP system cannot be meaningfully viewed in isolation but is always dependent on an integrated interaction with its eco-system of applications to map the end-to-end processes. Finding the individually most adequate solution is one thing – building it up and increasing the degree of integration for optimized processes is another. In a technology-driven, necessary renewal of existing applications, the opportunity for strategic ERP transformation should be taken. Breaking up monolithic structures and establishing an ERP system as the core (digital core) can release enormous potential and create the right conditions for the continued competitiveness of a company. However, this often leads to disruptive changes throughout the company and requires appropriate change management.\nThe right strategy for ERP transformation\nThe definition of an ERP transformation roadmap is never done in isolation\n, and various influences must be taken into account. The business strategy and the efforts of a digital business transformation are the main focus. But also the current degree of integration through historically grown software and technology landscapes are decisive criteria for the conception of the individually correct strategy and the development of a sensibly implementable roadmap.\nAdEx Partners has specialists from all areas involved and experience with various software solutions. Our focus in ERP transformation is clearly on a holistic strategy, which is less IT-driven and more business-driven, thus releasing new potential, providing flexibility, and securing market positions for the future. Together with you, we develop your business-oriented and technologically inspired ERP landscape strategy and accompany you in the step-by-step implementation and acquisition of the required skills.\nTogether with you, we will achieve this – and even more:\nEvaluation of the company capabilities needed in the future and the associated technological requirements\nAnalysis of the current ERP landscape in a maturity check\nDevelopment of an ERP strategy and roadmap including an estimate of costs and realizable added value\nSupport in the selection of implementation partners\nSupport and coaching in the context of technical implementation at project and program management level"

A common misconception is that it is primarily a necessary technical step in developing applications and a task reserved for IT professionals. The truth is, only a tight cooperation with the respective experts from the business yields data-driven applications supporting the business goals. Data models serve as a communication tool in achieving that aim.\nDomain-driven data modeling is a modern approach, with overarching elements such as the Enterprise Conceptual Data Model and data model governance. The approach is structured and yet pragmatic, guided by the areas with the highest business value."

    {
      "text": "Why is data modeling relevant today?\nData models are a communication tool between people, most notably from the business and IT departments, as well as a blueprint for building data-centered applications. These broad expectations on data models point out that data modeling is a fundamental activity. However, in reality it is often undervalued and underrepresented. In projects people tend to focus more on the syntax and technical aspects of data modeling, instead of being driven by the business value of it. Data exploitation derived from the business targets leads to a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nThe benefits of data modeling are diverse and are summarized in the illustration below.\nData modeling supports strategy.\nGood data modeling practices lead to more adaptable data structures and higher efficiency when implementing strategic changes. Data transparency facilitates merger and acquisitions strategies.\nThe\ncollaboration\nbetween different functions and units, especially between business and IT is promoted by communication data models in a technology-neutral way, but still with enough detail to enable a creation of physical data structures.\nIncreased performance and reduced costs.\nIn the modern data storage solutions, the most expensive component is not storage but rather computation. In general, a good data model will reduce the cost of the queries, as well as lead to less complex code and thus increase application speed and reduce implementation and maintenance efforts.\nUnderstanding and improvement of business processes.\nData modeling forces the company to articulate its business and its processes. It is not possible to define the structure and dynamics of data if it is not known how business is operating\nFaster time to value and increased efficiency.\nWith data modeling, business users can have a direct hand in defining core business rules which means fewer revisions are needed at implementation time. This increases efficiency and reduces costs.\nImproved data quality.\nData modeling can help to identify errors and inconsistencies in the data, which improves the overall quality of the data.\nData modeling became a much more complex endeavor in recent years. The increased complexity and dynamics of the data architecture landscape, exponentially higher data volumes, as well as new technology trends and advancements in the area of AI/ML are the most prominent factors. Combined with the continuously changing business requirements, data modeling must be executed in a structured way in order to be effective.\nThe good news is that reaching ideas how to build data models per use case became significantly easier. There are many resources about data modeling patterns and industry-specific standards. Furthermore, there are tools suggesting physical data model structures based on provided data, and GenAI is able to generate parts of data models based on the provided requirements. However, all of this does not replace the need for data modelers.\nNeed for data modeling as activity remains\n. Creating data models has not only a pure requirements and technical perspective, but is also a product of an agreement and common understanding between the relevant stakeholders from Business and IT."

    {
      "text": "How to implement and manage data models within a holistic approach?\nEnterprise data is spread across various data stores, managed centrally or by individual decentral units. Enterprise-wide analytics requires that the underlying data from different sources can be integrated and combined in a desired way. In order to achieve that, a common data model is needed, representing a collective understanding of business entities, relationships, and rules, thus achieving overall acceptance.\nEnterprise Data Model (EDM)\nis such overarching common data model, created as a collaborative effort of different levels and units of the business. It is a holistic layer-based model, whose layers represent the enterprise, subject area, and application levels, and in addition correspond to a conceptual, logical, or physical data model type. The EDM provides a common vocabulary and reconciles differences between different understandings of the same business entity by providing corresponding mappings. For example, the entity Customer in a central department could be a Client in some decentral unit.\nThe top\nEnterprise Conceptual Data Model\nis the only centrally managed component. The subject area conceptual data models (CDM), as well as the corresponding logical (LDM) and physical data models (PDM) below are managed by the individual functional areas of an organization, such as Finance or Marketing.\nThe\nsubject area models\nenable the autonomy of the corresponding business domains over its data while adhering to the broader organizational standards. They are not standalone artifacts but are rather interlinked between each other, enabling the enterprise-wide integration. This\ndomain-driven design\nis also incorporated in the data mesh approach, a decentralized sociotechnical data architecture that reinforces the concept of data as a product of individual domains.\nThe policies, procedures, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of data modeling within an organization are managed by the\ndata model governance\n. It focuses on the oversight and regulation of the data modeling efforts and is a part of the overall data governance function. One of the areas of data model governance is a setup of internal data modeling guidelines, covering the aspects such as the data modeling notations, naming conventions, design standards, and documentation requirements. A regular quality control is another key aspect, where metrics like the Data Model Scorecard are applied when reviewing data models."

Be pragmatic and keep the benefits and efforts in balance. Start with quick wins first – areas with the highest business value.\nThe data modeling capability of an organization is a journey often characterized by levels in a corresponding\ncapability maturity level model\n. The maturity assessments enable the evaluation of the current state and show a roadmap on the way forward. From the initial ad-hoc efforts, the organization typically develops by establishing standards and subsequently governance policies, by introducing more advanced tools and continuous improvement practices.\nAdEx Partners offers a comprehensive approach for assessing the data modeling capabilities of your organization and steering them forward with you to meet your specific business needs.

At AdEx Partners, we regularly find that much of this potential value remains untapped. Not due to a lack of data or technology, but rather due to an ineffective approach to its use. Our observations also show that digitalization initiatives are often launched as isolated projects that fail to reach their full potential due to a lack of a comprehensive strategy and integration into the overall business.

Another critical factor is the lack of dedicated topic or governance owners who take responsibility for specific areas and actively drive them forward.

An agile approach is essential in order to be able to react flexibly to changes in regulatory requirements and market conditions without sacrificing efficiency.\nBottom-line support\nFrom an internal perspective, data should be managed as an independent product. This includes the introduction of data ownership and stewardship. It is crucial to consider data as an integral part of services or products, for example to improve controllability or for simulations.

By using big data and AI, this app can provide individualized savings and investment recommendations tailored to the specific needs of each customer. On the one hand, this potentially increases customer satisfaction and loyalty and, on the other, can create a new source of income for the bank by recommending tailored financial products.\nIn terms of data management as a standalone product, the bank could introduce a centralized data management system that brings together all customer data from different departments. This enables a unified view of customers and improves decision-making. The introduction of data governance and stewardship principles ensures that data quality and security remain at a high level. In addition, processes such as credit checks and risk analyses could be automated and thus made more efficient through the use of robotics and AI.\nAs a result, by implementing a dual strategy, a bank can not only improve its services through data-driven personalization, but also optimize its internal processes. This holds considerable potential for cost savings while simultaneously increasing customer satisfaction. It could also increase cross-selling rates and improve operational efficiency. This practical example shows how the strategic use of data can not only help to solve existing problems, but also open up new growth opportunities for traditional financial institutions."

People-centric transformation requires organizations to see people as their most valuable asset, but it does not mean that clients or products are neglected.

The processes that generate it or are managed with it and the insights gained from its evaluation and analysis are the basis and value driver of every business model. At AdEx Partners, I am responsible for the portfolio area of\nData Value Management\nand thus help our clients with all issues related to\ndata and business processes\n: from data governance and business process management to business intelligence, analytics and data science as well as applications such as artificial intelligence, process mining and robotic process automation.\nFor me, Data Value Management is not just an IT topic, but essential for the entire company. Across industries, I support the management level of our clients in taking responsibility for their data, working consciously with it and thus creating the greatest possible value for the company. The basis for this is a comprehensive data strategy as well as the establishment or expansion of holistic\ndata governance\nwith the right tools for an integrated IT landscape. Essential for my work is on the one hand the further development of the business model of my clients and on the other hand the empowerment and motivation of the employees who work with the data.\nI started my consulting career in 1999 at PwC Consulting with a focus on SAP R/3, later moving to Accenture where I was able to broaden my\nSAP knowledge\nand gain experience as a\nproject manager\nin large\ntransformation projects\n, including in the UK, Switzerland and Singapore. With the desire to also get to know “the other side” of the business, in 2012 I moved to a large family-owned company in the travel retail sector in Hamburg. The experiences from this time help me – since 2016 at AdEx Partners again as a consultant – to better understand the perspective of my customers, their challenges and motivations, to jointly find sustainable solutions at eye level.\nDuring my studies in industrial engineering at the Helmut Schmidt University of the German Armed Forces in Hamburg and my subsequent work as an officer, I already worked on the intersection between business and technical topics and learned that even the best technology is only as good as the people and the organization that uses it. In my diploma thesis on integrated mobility concepts, I dealt with data and its value-adding use in networked systems for the first time. This is a topic that has stuck with me ever since and that I now drive forward with a great deal of commitment together with my customers.\nI live with my family in Hamburg, enjoy traveling and sailing, and ride my gravel bike as often as I can. I am very interested in the latest developments in electric mobility as well as sustainability in general."

      "text": "Your Trusted Advisor\nAs a manager at AdEx Partners, I`m specialized in the development of\ndigital strategies\nand the management of\ntransformations\n.\nIn the course of my many years as a consultant, I help our clients to change sustainably and optimize business models through\nbusiness model transformation\nby using innovative approaches to strategy. By using digital tools, a strategy can be developed both, bottom-up and top-down and communicated efficiently. This enables a quick and efficient start to the subsequent\nbusiness transformation\n.\nFor project and program management of large transformations, a structured approach is just as important as a sense for the interpersonal. As a leader of various international projects and large programs, I structure the strategic goals, organization, agile ways of working and reporting with proven methods such as Design Thinking, Scaled Agile Frameworks, MVP approaches, and more.\nFor the success of a\nbusiness strategy\nand the associated\ntransformation\nin a VUCA world, both standardized approaches and creativity are needed. I often act as a translator between the business and IT world.\nA good example of this are the challenges of\nstrategic company acquisitions\nand carve-outs. A very flourishing private equity market and the pressure to quickly occupy digital business areas has led to a steady increase in the number of\nM&A activities\n. Thus the success of M&A activities is therefore even more dependent on the right strategy to gain a competitive advantage. A fast identification of synergies and agile approaches in the implementation are critical for success. During\nintegration or carve-out\n, IT in particular is a cost driver and requires special attention when developing a\npost-merger integration strategy\n. My focus is on the development of customized solutions around the full M&A life cycle.\nComplex challenges and conceptual questions are my passion.\nThat’s why I joined AdEx Partners in 2021 and, in addition to my strategy and transformation projects, I contribute by building the new AdEx corporate strategy and managing our pro bono projects.

It requires customization to fit your specific needs and align with your organization’s maturity.\nIn today’s volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world, the traditional approach to business falls short. Agile, with its emphasis on adaptability and continuous improvement, provides the flexibility businesses need to navigate these uncertain times. It fosters a culture of teamwork and innovation, empowering businesses to react quickly and effectively to market changes.\nAdEx Partners can work jointly with your team to assess your current situation, design a target scenario, and guide you towards achieving it. Our approach integrates the best of both agile and traditional methodologies to tackle the challenges of a complex world, creating a unique hybrid environment tailored to your needs."

Traditional structures often struggle to keep pace with the fast-evolving landscape, leading to missed opportunities, decreased competitiveness, and a decline in business performance.\nIn the conventional business world, companies often get ensnared in the complexities of waterfall project management, hierarchical structures, rigid work schedules, and intricate solution architectures. These factors can foster a silo mentality, create a web of dependencies, and result in long, inflexible lead times, leaving a workforce that’s task-focused, micromanaged, and ill-equipped to respond swiftly to market changes.\nUnpacking Agile:"

It’s a strategic approach that emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and constant improvement. Agile methodologies prioritize customer satisfaction and encourage a collaborative, team-oriented culture. They focus on delivering value early and often, and continuously adapting to changes, whether in customer needs or market conditions.\nLean Agile, an extension of the agile philosophy, goes a step further by eliminating waste and enhancing value. It aims to deliver maximum value with minimal work, thereby improving efficiency and productivity. Scaled agility allows businesses to apply these benefits across multiple teams, creating a united, flexible organization that’s better prepared to handle change."

It’s about integrating the best of both worlds—combining the stability of traditional structures with the flexibility of agile. By adopting lean portfolio management, organizing work around value, and working in small, frequent chunks, companies can reduce lead times and enhance employee satisfaction.\nWhen coupled with a modular, cloud-based architecture, this shift allows teams to innovate independently and respond quickly to market changes. Transitioning to this dynamic state isn’t merely a nice-to-have—it’s a necessity for companies aiming to succeed in today’s fast-paced business world."

It offers a strategic roadmap for how the organization will function in its desired future state, encompassing aspects such as people, processes, technology, culture, and governance. Unlike isolated solutions, a holistic TOM considers the interconnectedness of various components, ensuring that they work together synergistically to achieve the organization’s objectives.\nWhy is it relevant?\nA holistic TOM is relevant because it provides a unified and strategic approach to organizational transformation and development. It aligns all aspects of the organization towards a common goal, fostering better coordination, improved efficiency, and enhanced performance. By addressing various dimensions of an organization’s functioning, it ensures that changes are not isolated or piecemeal but contribute to a coherent and successful transformation. This relevance extends to adapting to market changes, maximizing resources, and staying competitive in dynamic environments.\nWhy are we doing this?\nWe are implementing a holistic Target Operating Model (TOM) to facilitate a comprehensive and structured transformation within our organization. By adopting a holistic approach, we aim to bring all facets of our operations in line with our strategic goals. This ensures that changes are well-coordinated, resources are optimized, and every part of the organization is contributing to the overall transformation. By doing this, we can achieve sustainable growth, improved efficiency, and a competitive edge in the industry.\nWhat are the pain points?\nWithout a holistic Target Operating Model (TOM), organizations often face several pain points during transformation initiatives. These include fragmented processes that hinder efficient operations, lack of alignment among different departments, and disjointed technology implementations that result in inefficiencies. Additionally, absence of a holistic approach can lead to resistance to change among employees, unclear accountability, and difficulties in measuring the success of transformation efforts. Addressing these pain points through a holistic TOM helps overcome these challenges and ensures a smoother, more successful transformation journey."

Legacy architectures integrated with this include SAP, Baan, amdocs Clarify and ERP systems in medium-sized companies. My customers pursue different implementation strategies: greenfield, brownfield and hybrid variants, which I successfully implement with them.\nMy aim is to cover the sustainable implementation of Customer Centricity across the relevant dimensions: from the design of the business model to safeguard the strategy, to the development of suitable operating models and new ways of working. As a strong proponent of Salesforce’s ‘Well Architected’ framework, I always work proactively to ensure Enterprise Architecture principles through balanced governance and DevOps frameworks.\nI am driven by constant curiosity and further development. My credo is “Do not give right answers, pose the right questions”, since the new and rapidly increasing potential of ML & AI solutions can only be exploited by the players in the best possible way if knowledge can be used to create value through suitable questions. It spurs me on to bring technological, social and personal developments to my customers and to use them to create value.\nI’ve been with AdEx Partners since January 2021 and, as I was born in Westphalia, I’ve been living in the Rhine-Main area for many years. I have three children, some of whom are grown, and in my free time I enjoy skiing and hiking. I have also discovered golf as a balance for myself."

This includes the creation of a strategy for a customer-focused realignment as well as the implementation of\nCRM projects\n. I help our customers to implement CRM projects successfully and in the best possible way. My credo is “You can recognize the winner at the start”: For a successful project or a successful digital transformation it is necessary to think holistically from the beginning and to approach the many puzzle pieces in the right order. As a\nproject and program manager\nfor large transformation projects, I take responsibility for successfully shaping the implementation by system integrators alongside our customers.\nAfter a start at Accenture as an enterprise IT architect and integration expert, I have been focusing on CRM and Customer Centricity topics since 2010. During my time as Head of Consulting and later as CTO of a Munich-based Salesforce Boutique Partner, I was allowed to work on countless\nSalesforce\nimplementations directly or indirectly as a coach.\nBoth my bachelor’s degree and my final thesis (Dipl. Ing) were done in the usability lab at the Chair of Human-Machine Communication at the Technical University of Munich. The simple and intuitive implementation of complicated processes has always been my field of interest. It was therefore only logical that my path led me directly to Salesforce into the Solution Engineering Team, where I was able to work together with customers on Salesforce Solution Design for 5 years.\nThe combination of deep technical knowledge with many years of project and program management experience enables me to use this knowledge profitably for our customers.\nIn my private life I live with my family in the south of Munich, enjoy sailing and mountain biking."

My project experience is diverse. I have supported companies in strategic realignments and organizational transformations, worked with teams to design new forms of collaboration, have been responsible for change management, e.g. in the context of ERP implementations, and managed post-merger integration and carve-out projects in mergers & acquisition processes.\nThroughout my consulting work, I have been fascinated by the human factor in all change projects as a key success factor for effective transformations. With this in mind, after completing my degree in business administration, I delved deeper into the subject. I trained as a systemic coach, team developer and organizational developer and gradually adapted my consulting approach to the new findings.\nToday, I am convinced that changes must always be viewed holistically and in terms of interactions. For example, what impact does the planned reorganization have on people, culture, strategy, processes, roles and functions and what may need to be relearned? How should trustworthy communication be organized in the context of change or even in crises situations?\nAs an Associate Partner at AdEx Partners, I see myself as a companion to specialists and managers in developing the best solutions and change process designs for my clients. As a\nchange and transformation manager\n, I support companies both in their conceptual work and during the implementation of individual change projects or long-term organizational developments.\nI have been with AdEx Partners since 2023 and, as part of the\nOrganizational Transformation\nand\nPeople\nTeam, I actively contribute to the ongoing development of our competencies for the benefit of our clients.\nI have chosen Hamburg as the center of my life – but I feel comfortable wherever change is involved."

Especially in the area of sustainability, it is important to be prepared for the future.\nIn order to promote this and other transformation processes step by step, our AdEx experts also shed light on the possibilities of digital business models. These contribute to sustainable growth. While visitors of the past still had to laboriously note down measurements, your future customers would like to plan their own construction project in a relaxed manner from home with the help of their smartphone. We help you implement new ideas and the accompanying business model transformation.\nRadically changed price structures, supply chain difficulties and increasing online competition are also pushing for change. Your industry in particular is dependent on macroeconomic factors, as well as unpredictable influences like the weather. That’s why we at AdEx Partners are concerned with your pricing, warehouse management and portfolio management, among other things. Only in this way can the most important value drivers, based on supply chain analytics, be identified and profitably applied."

For example, digitization offers the opportunity to increase share of voice through targeted digital media marketing – even if other players have the data and access to consumers. Or to increase efficiency and transparency in supply chains through the digital delivery bill.\nHow can you leverage the potential of digitization while keeping an eye on regulatory frameworks and avoiding conflicts with traditional brick-and-mortar channels?\nAt AdEx Partners, we are experts in overcoming such challenges and implementing concrete measures that strengthen your company’s crucial competitive advantage.

This often came at the expense of higher-margin actively managed products. Cost efficiency through the entire value creation chain of asset management therefore is crucial\nRise in interest rates\nwill also mean higher attractiveness of fixed income products and traditional savings accounts, which results in lower demand for other asset classes. Sell side market participants and their organization will need to be able to flexibly react to these changed demands\nOn the other hand, due to high interest rates, corporates will increasingly seek financing through equity\n– Sell side market participants and their organization will need to be able to flexibly react to these changed demands\nOverall, a long-term higher interest rate level will enable banks to generate higher revenues\n– This will give more room to maneuver and to also address structural issues in core IT and architecture, which have often been neglected during the past phase of low interest rates and revenues\nRemaining competitive in a changing market\nNumber of market participants is shrinking, size of market participants increases\n– Ability to efficiently execute M&A activities, and carry out merger/post-merger-integration can be a requirement for organizations\nOperating at high volumes is paramount for profitability; large international providers are entering European Market\n– Scalability of processes and IT are a prerequisite\nOperational excellence is key to succeed in increasingly competitive markets\n– Organization, processes and IT need to be streamlined accordingly and workforce enabled\nFintechs, and Global players drive innovation\n– Capital Markets organizations must be able meet the pace of technology leaders to stay competitive. Market transparency and increased client mobility means leveraging cutting edge technology is a must\nTraditional European players covering a broad range of services compete with specialists in all their business areas\n– Focus on core strengths and strategic business fields complemented with providing clients access to complementing products and services becomes the norm\nStaying one step ahead in technological progress\nSpeed, agility and scalability of IT\n– Cloud and hyperscaler platforms are the central for state-of-the-art OIT architecture in financial services industry\nIT Resilience\n– After years of limited investment in IT on one hand and increasing demands on the other, IT resilience has become a focal point in the public perception of the entire banking industry\nEfficient and flexible IT Organization to support growth and keep enable innovation\n– An effective IT Operating Model (ITOM) is crucial, to fulfill the increasing requirements of capital markets organizations\nNew asset classes, such as crypto currencies or NFTs\nand new processes, such as digital security issuance, require agile, secure and high performing IT architecture\nAI has become mainstream\nsince the emergence of language model chat bots into the public space. It will fundamentally change the way investment decision are being taken, by both retail and institutional investors and how trading is being executed. Capital market players will need to prepare. A first and crucial step lies in the optimization and integration of data management throughout the organization\nProvide the right services\nExisting and upcoming EU regulation, such as Taxonomy Regulation, Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), EU Green Bonds Regulation (EUGBR), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)\n– Require strong and focused analytical and implementation capabilities for staff, processes and IT of Capital Markets organizations\nInstitutional buy-side as well as retail investors are increasingly demanding ESG compliant products\n– Reflecting all requirement is a challenge for the entire value creation process, especially data management\nSustainability and compliance ESG-criteria are increasingly a must-have factor for clients (both retail and wholesale) when choosing capital markets providers\n– The whole organization needs to be set up accordingly\nPositive environmental and social impact as an opportunity to drive growth and higher public-market valuations"

      "text": "The 5 Hot Topics for European Banks and Financial Service Providers\nRegulatory\nUncertain geopolitical environment\nTechnological change\nCompetitive pressure\nSkills shortage\nExpand processes while keeping an eye on regulatory requirements\nImplementation of DORA, Basel IV & Co.:\nDORA is intended to increase the resilience of financial companies to IT-related risks, Basel IV is to further tighten capital requirements and introduce stricter rules for the risk assessment of credit portfolios.\nClimate change risk assessment:\nregulators are expected to increase climate change risk disclosure requirements to ensure that banks understand and respond appropriately to their climate change risks.\nDigital Identity:\nregulators could encourage the adoption of Digital Identities to increase security in online transactions and prevent fraud.\nMonitoring BigTech companies:\nregulators could increase oversight of BigTech companies that provide financial services to ensure they meet the same regulatory standards as traditional banks.\nData protection:\nit is likely that data protection will remain an important regulatory focus in the future as consumer concerns about the protection of their data continue to grow.\nThe right answers in times of political and economic uncertainty\nPolitical uncertainty:\nThe political changes and instabilities in many countries may jeopardize the stability of the financial system and have a negative impact on the financial markets. This can lead to investor uncertainty and affect confidence in the financial system.\nTerrorism and cybercrime:\nThe increasing threat of terrorist activities and cyberattacks may also have an impact on European banks. Cyberattacks can lead to the theft of data and information, which can undermine customers’ trust in banks.\nSanctions and trade wars:\nThe intensification of sanctions and trade wars may lead to an increase in geopolitical risks, which may have a negative impact on the economy and financial markets. This may lead to a decrease in trade volumes and an increase in credit risks.\nRapidly rising interest rates:\nThe rapid rise in market interest rates can put institutions in a tight spot. In the past, financial institutions granted long-term loans at low interest rates and now have to pay significantly more for their refinancing.\nUkraine war:\nFor banks, a loss of customers in particularly affected economic sectors is difficult to assess. Exposures to customers with close business ties to Russia or Ukraine need to be reviewed. However, customers who have already been significantly affected by the pandemic may also pose an increased risk.\nThe right answers in times of political and economic uncertainty\nCompetition from fintech startups:\nThe emerging fintech companies offer innovative and convenient solutions for banking services. This can lead to traditional banks losing customers to these new providers.\nCyber security:\nAdvancing digitalization increases the risk of cyber attacks on banks and their customers. Banks must ensure that they have sufficient protective mechanisms in place to minimize this threat.\nChanges in customer behavior:\nToday’s customers expect a seamless experience when it comes to banking services. They are willing to switch to mobile solutions and use online banking. Banks need to ensure they can meet these expectations to remain competitive.\nRegulatory requirements:\nTechnological change also has an impact on the regulatory requirements for banks. Banks must ensure that they meet these requirements and adapt their processes accordingly.\nLegacy systems:\nMany banks have outdated systems that make it difficult to adapt to changing technology. However, updating these systems can create another challenge for banks.\nWithstanding competition and making the right decisions in times of change\nRapidly rising interest rates:\nThe rapid rise in market interest rates can put institutions in a tight spot. In the past, financial institutions granted long-term loans at low interest rates and now have to pay significantly more for their refinancing.\nDigital transformation:\nDigitization has led to new, technology-based competitors such as Fintechs and BigTechs entering the market and putting established banks under pressure. Banks must therefore adapt their business models and processes to remain competitive.\nRegulation:\nBanking regulation in Europe is very complex and extensive, which is a challenge for smaller banks in particular. They have to allocate additional resources to compliance and risk management, which can affect their competitiveness.\nGeopolitical uncertainties:\nGeopolitical tensions, trade conflicts and political unrest can affect economic stability and thus impact banks’ business.\nDemographic change:\nThe European population is aging, leading to a change in demand for financial products. Banks must adapt their offerings accordingly to meet the needs of the older population.\nAddressing change with the right professionals\nRecruiting skilled workers:\nOne of the biggest challenges facing European banks is finding and recruiting qualified skilled workers. Highly qualified employees are scarce, especially in the areas of technology and digitalization. It is difficult to find applicants with the right skills and experience and to poach them from competitors.\nCompetitiveness:\nThe shortage of skilled workers can affect banks’ competitiveness. If they are unable to attract the right talent, they may struggle to compete with other banks and FinTech companies that have a talented workforce.\nCost:\nHiring and retaining skilled professionals can be expensive. Banks may need to offer higher salaries and benefits to attract and retain talent. This can increase costs for the bank and affect its profitability.\nRisks:\nSkilled labor shortages can also increase the risk of errors and fraud. When banks do not have enough skilled employees to adequately perform all tasks and responsibilities, errors and risks can occur that can lead to financial losses.\nInnovation:\nHiring talent is critical to banks’ ability to innovate. If they do not have the right talent, they may struggle to develop new products and services and innovate business models to keep pace with the rapidly changing needs of customers."

IT crimes cause lasting damage to both companies and private individuals\nClimate change is rapidly altering\nthe fundamentals of risk models\non which insurance products are based.\nEveryday life is increasingly supported by sensor technology.

This involves embracing change, fostering innovation, and adopting a patient-centric approach to provide the solutions the patients need. Yet only a handful of established pharmaceutical companies have embarked on this comprehensive transformation journey.\nThe journey towards becoming a hyper-adaptive organization in the pharmaceutical industry is not without challenges. It requires a deep understanding of the industry’s complexities, foresight to anticipate future trends, and the agility to adapt to changing environments.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning are being leveraged and create new opportunities to shape the future.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning:\nThese technologies are driving the digital revolution in the pharmaceutical industry by processing large data sets and identifying new drug targets. They are also enhancing the efficiency of drug development, manufacturing, and distribution processes.\nBig Data:\nThe availability of vast amounts of data is a key factor in the digital revolution. Big data allows for more accurate predictions and insights, leading to improved drug discovery and patient care.\nCloud Computing:\nThis technology provides the infrastructure needed to store and process the large amounts of data generated in the pharmaceutical industry. It also enables real-time collaboration and data sharing among researchers.\nCybersecurity\n: As the pharmaceutical industry becomes more digital, the importance of cybersecurity increases. Protecting sensitive data from breaches is crucial to maintaining trust and compliance with regulations.\nA new era of healthcare: The eHealth revolution through telemedicine, mobile health applications and other digital tools is enabling continuous patient monitoring and personalized care, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.\nTelemedicine:\nTelemedicine allows patients to consult with healthcare professionals remotely, improving access to care and reducing healthcare costs.\nMobile Health Apps:\nThese apps enable continuous patient monitoring and personalized care. They can improve patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans.\nInternet of Things (IoT):\nIoT devices like wearable health monitors can collect real-time health data, enabling proactive care and early intervention.\nData Privacy\n: As eHealth technologies collect and store sensitive health data, ensuring data privacy is a key concern. Compliance with data protection regulations is crucial.\nTailoring treatment to the Individual: Companies are using genetic and other data to craft therapies tailored to individual patients. AI and Machine Learning play a crucial role in processing large data sets to identify new (personalized) drug targets.\nGenomics:\nThe study of an individual’s genes (genomics) is a key factor in personalized medicine. It allows for the development of therapies tailored to a patient’s genetic makeup.\nAI and Machine Learning:\nThese technologies are crucial for processing large data sets to identify new drug targets and predict patient responses to different treatments.\nBiobanking:\nThe collection and preservation of biological samples (biobanking) is essential for personalized medicine. It provides the raw material for genetic analysis and drug development.\nRegulatory Environment:\nThe development and application of personalized medicine must comply with regulations concerning patient consent, data privacy, and genetic testing.\nThere is increasing pressure on companies to make medications more affordable and accessible. Innovative strategies such as value-based pricing models are being explored to ensure patients have access to the vital drugs they need.\nValue-Based Pricing Models:\nThese models link the price of a drug to its effectiveness, ensuring that patients have access to the vital drugs they need.\nSupply Chain Efficiency:\nStreamlining supply chains and reducing production costs can make medications more affordable.\nGeneric Drugs:\nThe development and promotion of generic drugs can help reduce medication costs and increase accessibility.\nHealth Insurance Policies:\nThe policies of health insurance companies, including coverage and reimbursement rates, significantly influence the affordability and accessibility of medications.\nHeightened scrutiny from regulators worldwide is a reality for companies in this industry. Compliance with evolving regulations concerning data privacy, drug safety, and other critical issues e.g., IDMP ISO Standards (Identification of Medicinal Products) is a necessity.\nGlobal Regulations:\nUnderstanding and complying early with global and local regulations regarding data privacy or drug safety is critical, as well as global standards such as IDMP (Identification of Medicinal Products ISO Standards).\nData Management:\nEffective data management is essential for regulatory compliance, particularly with regulations concerning data privacy and IDMP.\nCompliance Systems:\nRobust compliance systems are needed to navigate the complex regulatory landscape and ensure adherence to all regulations.\nEnvironmental Regulations:\nPharmaceutical companies bear a significant responsibility in relation to environmental considerations, such as managing waste from antibiotic production or mitigating their impact on climate change."

The “maturing” process is critical here. Organizational transformation is an evolutionary development that needs to be shaped sustainably.\nStart where you are\nEvery company is unique and has developed its own individual structures over time, shaped by processes, technologies, working methods and above all the people involved. Changes to these structures, e.g. for process optimization, cost savings or increased flexibility, must include and coordinate all these areas. The analysis of the existing operational processes identifies the strategic need for action and defines the organizational guidelines. Based on the defined goals,\nan organizational design with a suitable change concept\ncan be created, which substantiates the implementation measures.\nEstablishing transformation as a permanent process\nThe continuous accompaniment of the implementation of individual measures up to the complete integration as an integral part of your team is a matter of course for us.

So individuell wie die Unternehmen, deren Probleme und deren Ziele sind, so individuell und spezifisch müssen auch die Transformationen gestaltet, gemanagt und vorangetrieben werden.\nEs gibt nicht „die eine“ Methode, die eine erfolgreiche Transformation garantiert. Die Wegbereiter zu einer erfolgreichen Transformation sind engagierte, erfahrene Menschen, die in der Lage sind, einen Transformationsfahrplan zu erstellen, der so individuell ist, wie die Organisation, ihr Problem und ihr Ziel.\nEs gibt keine Transformation um ihrer selbst willen. Es muss einen geschäftlichen Grund geben, ein Problem, das überwunden werden muss, ein Ziel, das erreicht werden soll, um eine Umgestaltung zu beginnen. Ohne dies hat eine Transformation keinen Zweck, kann also auch keinen Erfolg und kein Ende haben. Fusionen und Übernahmen, neue Geschäftsmodelle, mehr Agilität oder die Steigerung der digitalen Fähigkeiten sind geschäftliche Gründe für den Beginn einer Transformation. Das Ende einer Transformation zu erkennen, dann wenn ein stabiler Zustand erreicht ist, ist genauso wichtig, wie die Initiierung der Transformation.\nGerne diskutieren wir unsere Überzeugung, dass Transformationen zu einem stabilen Zustand, einem Ende, führen müssen. Natürlich gibt immer Möglichkeiten der kontinuierlichen Verbesserung, aber dies ist keine Transformation, wie AdEx Partners sie versteht."

Denn eins steht fest:\nFinance muss reagieren, um einflussreich zu bleiben.\nWie wirkt sich der Fortschritt in der digitalen Landschaft auf den Finance-Bereich aus?\nDas Aufgabenfeld im Finanzwesen wird zukünftig immer weniger von repetitiven und transnationalen Tätigkeiten geprägt sein und hin zu mehr Analysen und intelligenten Auswertungen von internen und externen Datenquellen (\nBusiness Intelligence und Advanced Analytics\n) transferieren.\nDie entsprechende Technologie schafft vollständige Transparenz, robuste digitale Sicherheit und unbestreitbares Vertrauen. Kognitive Netzwerke und KI lösen komplexe Probleme schneller und genauer als jeder Mensch. Finance kann Daten aus beliebigen Quellen in unbegrenzten Mengen verarbeiten und zuverlässig die effektivsten Geschäftsergebnisse vorhersagen.\nNeben den Ansprüchen an die Technologie\nändern sich auch die fachlichen Anforderungen in immer kürzeren Zyklen\n.

Dieser ist sie jedoch nicht immer gewachsen, wird als Risiko – Cyber Security -, Engpass – Ressourcenknappheit und Lieferfähigkeit – oder als Innovationshemmnis – Cloud, AI und digitale Plattformen – wahrgenommen."

      "text": "Zukunftsfähige IT gestalten\nDie Fähigkeit, direkt und zielgerichtet auf Veränderungen reagieren zu können und sich anzupassen, wird mehr und mehr zum substanziellen Erfolgsfaktor. Zentraler Dreh- und Angelpunkt für digitalisierte, zukunftsfähige Geschäftsstrukturen ist die IT.\nWar die IT bisher eher ein operative Service-Einheit mit Fokus auf die verlässliche Bereitstellung von IT Dienstleistungen\nentwickelt sie sich nunmehr zunehmend zu einem integralen Bestandteil der Wertschöpfung der Unternehmen\n. Digitale Plattformen, Digitalisierung von Produkten und Servicenageboten und nicht zuletzt auch Abhängigkeit effizienter Geschäfts- und Kundenprozesse von Informationen und Technologie machen die IT zu einem Kernfaktor unternehmerischen Erfolges.\nDie Transformation der IT ist also weit mehr als die Beantwortung der Frage, wie neue Technologien in bestehende Architekturen integriert werden können. Neue Methoden sind notwendig und müssen im Unternehmen gelebt, gelernt und erlebt werden können. Bestehende Arbeitsmodelle müssen im Kontext der Verschmelzung von IT und Geschäftsbereichen neu gedacht werden. Agile endkundenfokussierte Entwicklung, kontinuierliche Änderung (CI/ CD), adaptive Skalierung unter Nutzung von Hyperscalern, Sicherung digitaler Sicherheit bis hin zur umfassenden Transformation des IT Operating Modells  hin zu produktorientierte Aufstellung und gemeinsamen Value Streams mit den Geschäftsbereichen sind nur einige der Herausforderungen, die moderne IT Organisation bewältigen müssen. Und nicht zu vergessen: die Mitarbeiter. Sie gestalten die Veränderung, müssen sie verstehen und mittragen.\nMit Automation und Disruption der hohen Veränderungsgeschwindigkeit begegnen.\nIT-Transformationen sind komplex. Veränderungen wirken sich meist auf sämtliche Geschäftsbereiche aus und beeinflussen die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit des Unternehmens. Die technologische Disruption und die Anpassung der internen IT, um auf aktuelle, absehbare und noch nicht bekannte Erfordernisse reagieren zu können, als fortwährenden Prozess zu etablieren, ist die Hauptanforderung an entsprechende Transformationsvorhaben. Im Grunde geht es also darum,\ndie IT als inhärenten Bestandteil der Wertschöpfung zu begreifen\nund derart wandlungsfähig aufzustellen, dass sie Treiber digitaler Transformation des ganzen Unternehmens ist.\nVeränderungen in der IT-Organisation werden oft punktuell und ohne Gesamtblick auf das Unternehmen vorgenommen – vielfach führen diese dann nicht zum gewünschten Ergebnis. In Unkenntnis ihrer Leistungsfähigkeit und der steigenden Geschäftsanforderungen wird die IT nicht zielgerichtet gesteuert. Daraus resultieren Leistungen, die von den Fachbereichen als nicht ausreichend oder als wenig unterstützend angesehen werden.\nMit unserer Erfahrung aus vielzähligen Transformationsprojekten, umfangreichem Technologiewissen und der pragmatischen Herangehensweise unterstützen wir Sie von der\nDefinition der neuen strategischen Richtung bis hin zur Umsetzung\n. Ohne Verpflichtung gegenüber bestimmten Technologieanbietern stehen wir als neutraler Berater an Ihrer Seite, unsere einzige Verpflichtung ist Ihr Erfolg.\nDas leisten wir gemeinsam mit Ihnen – und noch mehr:\nDurchführung eines IT-Assessments, um die nötige Transparenz zu schaffen (wie u.a. Identifizierung von Wertsteigerungspotenzialen, Evaluierung der IT-Prozessreife und der IT-Leistungsfähigkeit, Überprüfung der Applikations- und Infrastrukturlandschaft, Überprüfung des Projektportfolios in Bezug auf den fachlichen Bedarf, Beurteilung, ob die zukünftigen Anforderungen der Fachbereiche durch die IT abgedeckt werden können, etc.)\nEntwicklung eines neuen Operating Models für neue Produkte, Services oder Marktauftritte\nStandardisierung, Automatisierung und Harmonisierung Ihrer Organisation"

This results in the need for\ntransformation management\nnot to simply let change happen, but to build and empower a balanced team to master the upcoming change.

Outstanding qualities for this include my methodological competence, my foresight, my team orientation and my perseverance. As a\ntrusted advisor\n, a clear vision, a solid process model and the involvement of the project team and the organization are particularly important to me.
