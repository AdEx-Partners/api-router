July 2024\n\nnew challenges for an ERP\n\nEvaluation of the company capabilities needed in the future and the associated technological requirements\n\nThe ERP system as a hub for digital business modelsIn the course of the digitalization of business processes, more and more and larger amounts of data are created. At the same time, there is a growing need for companies to be able to act more efficiently, transparently, flexible and integrated. In its basic function, an ERP used to manage all necessary information about resources such as material, personnel, capacities or finances; however, thenew challenges for an ERPlie in transforming thisinformation into recommendations for action for the user, taking into account the current context(market situation, customer interaction, priorities, etc.) to support better, data-based decision-making.Competing priorities and metrics of different business areas and processes need to be revised and finally subordinate themselves to the goal of “fulfilled customer expectations”. Only by connecting and implementingstrategic processes and associated capabilities across business units,can the associated ERP landscape deliver a value-enhancing contribution to improving market position and competitiveness.An ERP system cannot be meaningfully viewed in isolation but is always dependent on an integrated interaction with its eco-system of applications to map the end-to-end processes. Finding the individually most adequate solution is one thing – building it up and increasing the degree of integration for optimized processes is another. In a technology-driven, necessary renewal of existing applications, the opportunity for strategic ERP transformation should be taken. Breaking up monolithic structures and establishing an ERP system as the core (digital core) can release enormous potential and create the right conditions for the continued competitiveness of a company. However, this often leads to disruptive changes throughout the company and requires appropriate change management.The right strategy for ERP transformationThe definition of an ERP transformation roadmap is never done in isolation, and various influences must be taken into account. The business strategy and the efforts of a digital business transformation are the main focus. But also the current degree of integration through historically grown software and technology landscapes are decisive criteria for the conception of the individually correct strategy and the development of a sensibly implementable roadmap.AdEx Partners has specialists from all areas involved and experience with various software solutions. Our focus in ERP transformation is clearly on a holistic strategy, which is less IT-driven and more business-driven, thus releasing new potential, providing flexibility, and securing market positions for the future. Together with you, we develop your business-oriented and technologically inspired ERP landscape strategy and accompany you in the step-by-step implementation and acquisition of the required skills.Together with you, we will achieve this – and even more:Evaluation of the company capabilities needed in the future and the associated technological requirementsAnalysis of the current ERP landscape in a maturity checkDevelopment of an ERP strategy and roadmap including an estimate of costs and realizable added valueSupport in the selection of implementation partnersSupport and coaching in the context of technical implementation at project and program management level\n\n6.

May 2024Why is data modeling a fundamental activity in supporting your data-driven business and how to approach it?\n\nThis means evolution in many process areas, but a revolution in particularly differentiating process areas. A well-plannedERP transformation is therefore always guided through the business with a focus on the company’s goals, with IT acting as a source of impetus, knowledge carrier, and partner for the realization of technical innovation potential.\n\nThe ERP system as a hub for digital business modelsIn the course of the digitalization of business processes, more and more and larger amounts of data are created.

Today, we are eagerly observing the development of the metaverse and the digitalisation of the analogue economy. Whoever succeeds in these markets is less and less likely to decide on products and services. Critical to success are the business models that serve the digital affinities of customers particularly well.Every company should know its market opportunities, translate them into concrete business goals for the analogue economy, e-commerce and the platform economy, and define in its business strategy the ways in which these goals are to be achieved. The basis for this is to be clear about the future viability of one’s current business models. Only then can business models with future potential be designed in a more customer-centric way and business models with low future potential be replaced by new, promising business models.»Business Model Transformation (BMT) is the management discipline that systematically evolves your company’s business model landscape to realise your company’s vision and strategy.«Digital products, services and sales channelsDigital products and services offer companies the opportunity to become more competitive, to offer customers previously unknown added value and to open up new business areas.Distribution channels that use digital communication tools, software and automated processes to initiate and conduct business play a significant role in this.

However, it is not always up to the task and is perceived as a risk – cyber security -, a bottleneck – scarcity of resources and ability to deliver – or an obstacle to innovation – cloud, AI and digital platforms.\n\nBuilding future-proof IT landscapesThe ability to react directly and purposefully to changes and to adapt is increasingly becoming a substantial success factor. The central pivot for digitalised, future-proof business structures is IT. While IT used to be more of an operational service unit with a focus on the reliable provision of IT services,it is now increasingly developing into an integral part of the value creation of companies.Digital platforms, digitalisation of products and service offerings and, last but not least, the dependence of efficient business and customer processes on information and technology make IT a core factor of corporate success.The transformation of IT is therefore much more than just answering the question of how new technologies can be integrated into existing architectures. New methods are necessary and must be lived, learned and experienced in the company. Existing working models have to be rethought in the context of the merging of IT and business units. Agile end-customer-focused development, continuous change (CI/CD), adaptive scaling using hyperscalers, securing digital security and the comprehensive transformation of the IT operating model to a product-oriented set-up and shared value streams with the business units are just some of the challenges that modern IT organisations have to overcome. And not to forget: the employees. They shape the change, have to understand it and support it.Meeting the high speed of change with automation and disruptionIT transformations are complex. Changes usually affect all business areas and influence the competitiveness of the company. Establishing technological disruption and the adaptation of internal IT to be able to react to current, foreseeable and as yet unknown requirements as an ongoing process is the main requirement for corresponding transformation projects. Basically,it is a matter of understanding IT as an inherent part of value creation and setting it up to be capable of changein such a way that it is the driver of the digital transformation of the entire company.Changes in the IT organisation are often made selectively and without an overall view of the company – in many cases they do not lead to the desired result. Unaware of its capabilities and the increasing business requirements, IT is not managed in a targeted manner. This results in services that are considered insufficient or unsupportive by the business departments.With our experience from numerous transformation projects, extensive technology knowledge and pragmatic approach, we support you from defining the new strategic direction to implementation. Without any commitment to specific technology providers, we stand by your side as a neutral advisor; our only commitment is your success.Together with you, we will achieve this – and even more:Conducting an IT assessment to create the necessary transparency (such as, among other things, identifying potential for value enhancement, evaluating IT process maturity and IT performance, reviewing the application and infrastructure landscape, reviewing the project portfolio in relation to business needs, assessing whether the future requirements of the business units can be met by IT, etc.).Development of a new operating model for new products, services or market appearancesStandardisation, automation and harmonisation of your organisation\n\nIT as a driver of digital transformation and the basis of modern business models\n\n18.

July 2024Open Application\n\nit is now increasingly developing into an integral part of the value creation of companies.\n\nBuilding future-proof IT landscapesThe ability to react directly and purposefully to changes and to adapt is increasingly becoming a substantial success factor. The central pivot for digitalised, future-proof business structures is IT. While IT used to be more of an operational service unit with a focus on the reliable provision of IT services,it is now increasingly developing into an integral part of the value creation of companies.Digital platforms, digitalisation of products and service offerings and, last but not least, the dependence of efficient business and customer processes on information and technology make IT a core factor of corporate success.The transformation of IT is therefore much more than just answering the question of how new technologies can be integrated into existing architectures. New methods are necessary and must be lived, learned and experienced in the company. Existing working models have to be rethought in the context of the merging of IT and business units. Agile end-customer-focused development, continuous change (CI/CD), adaptive scaling using hyperscalers, securing digital security and the comprehensive transformation of the IT operating model to a product-oriented set-up and shared value streams with the business units are just some of the challenges that modern IT organisations have to overcome. And not to forget: the employees. They shape the change, have to understand it and support it.Meeting the high speed of change with automation and disruptionIT transformations are complex. Changes usually affect all business areas and influence the competitiveness of the company. Establishing technological disruption and the adaptation of internal IT to be able to react to current, foreseeable and as yet unknown requirements as an ongoing process is the main requirement for corresponding transformation projects. Basically,it is a matter of understanding IT as an inherent part of value creation and setting it up to be capable of changein such a way that it is the driver of the digital transformation of the entire company.Changes in the IT organisation are often made selectively and without an overall view of the company – in many cases they do not lead to the desired result. Unaware of its capabilities and the increasing business requirements, IT is not managed in a targeted manner. This results in services that are considered insufficient or unsupportive by the business departments.With our experience from numerous transformation projects, extensive technology knowledge and pragmatic approach, we support you from defining the new strategic direction to implementation. Without any commitment to specific technology providers, we stand by your side as a neutral advisor; our only commitment is your success.\n\nAdEx Partners’ Swiss Digital Bootcamp25.

Thus, modern forms of data analysis and the development of AI models are increasingly becoming a competitive advantage.A change in the existing data centre strategy and a transformation to cloud-based services are becoming inevitable. Internet-oriented infrastructures, applications and various types of communication make it possible to carry out Work 4.0 to a large extent independent of time and place.Transferring architectures into new fields of digitalisation tasksIn today’s fast-changing world, it is crucial for companies to have a clear understanding of their current and future IT architecture and technologies, as well as a transparent transformation process. Trends such as remote working due to the pandemic, increasing use of AI and machine learning technologies, and breaking monolithic ERP architectures into modular applications – to name a few – require a deep knowledge of the technology challenges and opportunities for the business model to evolve it into a cloud-native enterprise.At AdEx Partners, we have developed a clearly defined process for conducting analysis, design, planning, and implementation. At all times, the focus is on the successful development and implementation of the strategy. We apply architectural principles and practices to guide organizations through the business, information, process, and technology changes required to implement their strategies.In addition, our approach reduces complexity by driving global technology standards. It enables technology solutions that are delivered based on modern principles and standards and can be used in a secure way across the enterprise.The architecture and technology transformation works across the entire IT service stack, from applications, workplace, and collaboration to infrastructure and end-user services. The Cloud Transformation team focuses on methodologies, policies, and governance.It is important to remember that a cloud transformation spans the entire deployment cycle from strategy to operations.Key componentsEnable & OptimiseEstablish global vendor management for cloud and data center services, transform the IT operating model into a cloud operating model, and design cloud base services and capabilities.Assess & DefineAssess the client’s current IT architecture and infrastructure and define the strategies and roadmaps for cloud and data centre operations, as well as digital workplaces.Manage & TransformConsulting on architecture topics and cloud and data center transformation.

The approach is structured and yet pragmatic, guided by the areas with the highest business value.Why is data modeling relevant today?Data models are a communication tool between people, most notably from the business and IT departments, as well as a blueprint for building data-centered applications. These broad expectations on data models point out that data modeling is a fundamental activity. However, in reality it is often undervalued and underrepresented. In projects people tend to focus more on the syntax and technical aspects of data modeling, instead of being driven by the business value of it. Data exploitation derived from the business targets leads to a competitive advantage in the marketplace.The benefits of data modeling are diverse and are summarized in the illustration below.Data modeling supports strategy.Good data modeling practices lead to more adaptable data structures and higher efficiency when implementing strategic changes. Data transparency facilitates merger and acquisitions strategies.Thecollaborationbetween different functions and units, especially between business and IT is promoted by communication data models in a technology-neutral way, but still with enough detail to enable a creation of physical data structures.Increased performance and reduced costs.In the modern data storage solutions, the most expensive component is not storage but rather computation. In general, a good data model will reduce the cost of the queries, as well as lead to less complex code and thus increase application speed and reduce implementation and maintenance efforts.Understanding and improvement of business processes.Data modeling forces the company to articulate its business and its processes. It is not possible to define the structure and dynamics of data if it is not known how business is operatingFaster time to value and increased efficiency.With data modeling, business users can have a direct hand in defining core business rules which means fewer revisions are needed at implementation time. This increases efficiency and reduces costs.Improved data quality.Data modeling can help to identify errors and inconsistencies in the data, which improves the overall quality of the data.Data modeling became a much more complex endeavor in recent years. The increased complexity and dynamics of the data architecture landscape, exponentially higher data volumes, as well as new technology trends and advancements in the area of AI/ML are the most prominent factors. Combined with the continuously changing business requirements, data modeling must be executed in a structured way in order to be effective.The good news is that reaching ideas how to build data models per use case became significantly easier. There are many resources about data modeling patterns and industry-specific standards. Furthermore, there are tools suggesting physical data model structures based on provided data, and GenAI is able to generate parts of data models based on the provided requirements. However, all of this does not replace the need for data modelers.Need for data modeling as activity remains. Creating data models has not only a pure requirements and technical perspective, but is also a product of an agreement and common understanding between the relevant stakeholders from Business and IT.How to implement and manage data models within a holistic approach?Enterprise data is spread across various data stores, managed centrally or by individual decentral units. Enterprise-wide analytics requires that the underlying data from different sources can be integrated and combined in a desired way. In order to achieve that, a common data model is needed, representing a collective understanding of business entities, relationships, and rules, thus achieving overall acceptance.Enterprise Data Model (EDM)is such overarching common data model, created as a collaborative effort of different levels and units of the business. It is a holistic layer-based model, whose layers represent the enterprise, subject area, and application levels, and in addition correspond to a conceptual, logical, or physical data model type. The EDM provides a common vocabulary and reconciles differences between different understandings of the same business entity by providing corresponding mappings. For example, the entity Customer in a central department could be a Client in some decentral unit.The topEnterprise Conceptual Data Modelis the only centrally managed component. The subject area conceptual data models (CDM), as well as the corresponding logical (LDM) and physical data models (PDM) below are managed by the individual functional areas of an organization, such as Finance or Marketing.Thesubject area modelsenable the autonomy of the corresponding business domains over its data while adhering to the broader organizational standards. They are not standalone artifacts but are rather interlinked between each other, enabling the enterprise-wide integration. Thisdomain-driven designis also incorporated in the data mesh approach, a decentralized sociotechnical data architecture that reinforces the concept of data as a product of individual domains.The policies, procedures, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of data modeling within an organization are managed by thedata model governance. It focuses on the oversight and regulation of the data modeling efforts and is a part of the overall data governance function. One of the areas of data model governance is a setup of internal data modeling guidelines, covering the aspects such as the data modeling notations, naming conventions, design standards, and documentation requirements. A regular quality control is another key aspect, where metrics like the Data Model Scorecard are applied when reviewing data models.Guiding principlesFrom the general point of view the followingguiding principlesare recommended in a data modeling approach:Make sure that the relevant subject matter experts (SMEs) from the business, as well as the IT experts are part of a collaborative effort to create or adjust the conceptual and logical data models.Use generic data modeling templates from the industry or the ones created with AI as an inspiration and a checklist and not as a first draft of your data model.The EDM itself does not include all the possible data models that exist in a company and focuses on the core enterprise daKeep the components of the Enterprise Data Model consistent with each other after every agile iteration.Creating the Enterprise Data Model is not an academic exercise, but rather a common-sense and practical endeavor. Be pragmatic and keep the benefits and efforts in balance. Start with quick wins first – areas with the highest business value.The data modeling capability of an organization is a journey often characterized by levels in a correspondingcapability maturity level model. The maturity assessments enable the evaluation of the current state and show a roadmap on the way forward. From the initial ad-hoc efforts, the organization typically develops by establishing standards and subsequently governance policies, by introducing more advanced tools and continuous improvement practices.AdEx Partners offers a comprehensive approach for assessing the data modeling capabilities of your organization and steering them forward with you to meet your specific business needs. We start with the analysis of the current state and drive the transformation initiatives accompanied by the best agile and project management practices.\n\nFrom the general point of view the followingguiding principlesare recommended in a data modeling approach:\n\nKeep the components of the Enterprise Data Model consistent with each other after every agile iteration.\n\nData modeling supports strategy.Good data modeling practices lead to more adaptable data structures and higher efficiency when implementing strategic changes.

This integration leverages cloud-based services and data storage, tightly coupled with the OS and apps, to deliver powerful GenAI capabilities without the need for explicit conversational interactions.Key themes from Apple’s AI strategy include:Multimodal I/O: Enabling text, audio, image, and video capabilities for both input and output, reflecting the natural ways humans interact.Agentic Functionality: Allowing OS and apps to inter-operate via “function calling,” coordinated by a kernel process LLM.Frictionless Integration: Ensuring features are seamlessly integrated, always on, and contextually aware.Proactive Initiatives: Anticipating user needs and initiating tasks without explicit prompts.Delegation Hierarchy: Balancing on-device intelligence with optional cloud-based processing.Modularity and Ecosystem Support: Supporting a growing ecosystem of LLMs.Privacy: Maintaining user privacy as a core principle.Parallels and Opportunities for Enterprise ClientsThe principles underlying Apple’s AI integration offer valuable insights for enterprises. Here’s how these concepts can be adapted to drive enterprise transformation:1Holistic Information ManagementEnterprises manage a vast array of information inputs, process triggers, events, transactions, and master data across diverse platforms. Integrating these elements across different platforms, business units, and partners can enhance efficiency and decision-making.2Leveraging GenAI for IntegrationBy adopting robust GenAI models, enterprises can address current limitations such as context window size, compute power constraints, and energy consumption. Smart integration and orchestration of these models can drive significant improvements in operational efficiency and innovation.3Custom Solutions for Unique LandscapesUnlike Apple, enterprises often operate within a complex and heterogeneous IT landscape. This includes a historical array of platforms, structures, and architectures for data and integrations, varying by division and geography. Tailored solutions are essential to navigate this complexity and achieve seamless integration.4Platform Diversity ManagementEven when focusing on major platforms like SAP and Salesforce, custom solutions and cross-ecosystem integrations will differ significantly. Enterprises must manage critical information, such as customer master data, which is often scattered across numerous applications.Our Approach to AI TransformationAt AdEx Partners, we combine our extensive experience and deep understanding of GenAI to guide enterprises through their AI transformation journey. Our services are designed to align with the strategic needs of mature enterprises, ensuring they harness the full potential of GenAI.Strategic GenAI IntegrationGenAI Vision and Strategy Development: Crafting a clear, strategic vision for GenAI adoption that aligns with business objectives.Use Case Portfolio Management: Identifying and prioritizing high-impact GenAI use cases to maximize business value.Roadmap and Implementation: Developing a comprehensive roadmap for GenAI integration, from ideation to full-scale deployment.Operational Excellence with GenAIApplication Lifecycle Management: Enhancing the lifecycle of enterprise applications through GenAI-driven solutions.IT Infrastructure Optimization: Leveraging GenAI to manage and optimize IT infrastructure, reducing technical debt and improving resilience.Process Automation: Automating routine tasks and processes with GenAI, freeing up resources for strategic initiatives.Innovation and GrowthProduct and Service Innovation: Developing new products and services powered by GenAI.Customer Experience Enhancement: Using GenAI to deliver personalized and engaging customer experiences.Business Model Transformation: Rethinking and reinventing business models with GenAI at their core.ConclusionThe integration of AI as demonstrated by Apple provides a powerful model for enterprises.

  "text": "Dual solution approachOne approach to countering this could be twofold: improving the customer offering on the one hand(top-line growth)and optimizing internal processes on the other(bottom-line growth).To better integrate data into customer products, the bank could develop a new app that offers customers personalized financial advice based on their transaction behavior and financial goals. By using big data and AI, this app can provide individualized savings and investment recommendations tailored to the specific needs of each customer. On the one hand, this potentially increases customer satisfaction and loyalty and, on the other, can create a new source of income for the bank by recommending tailored financial products.In terms of data management as a standalone product, the bank could introduce a centralized data management system that brings together all customer data from different departments. This enables a unified view of customers and improves decision-making. The introduction of data governance and stewardship principles ensures that data quality and security remain at a high level. In addition, processes such as credit checks and risk analyses could be automated and thus made more efficient through the use of robotics and AI.As a result, by implementing a dual strategy, a bank can not only improve its services through data-driven personalization, but also optimize its internal processes. This holds considerable potential for cost savings while simultaneously increasing customer satisfaction. It could also increase cross-selling rates and improve operational efficiency. This practical example shows how the strategic use of data can not only help to solve existing problems, but also open up new growth opportunities for traditional financial institutions.\n\nOne approach to countering this could be twofold: improving the customer offering on the one hand(top-line growth)and optimizing internal processes on the other(bottom-line growth).To better integrate data into customer products, the bank could develop a new app that offers customers personalized financial advice based on their transaction behavior and financial goals.

Most people are aware of this in theory, but not everyone derives concrete benefits from it.Yet the ability to use data effectively is crucial to a company’s success. At AdEx Partners, we regularly find that much of this potential value remains untapped. Not due to a lack of data or technology, but rather due to an ineffective approach to its use. Our observations also show that digitalization initiatives are often launched as isolated projects that fail to reach their full potential due to a lack of a comprehensive strategy and integration into the overall business. A coherent target picture that includes the entire architecture, data platforms, infrastructure technologies and the project portfolio harbors enormous efficiency potential that often remains untapped.A coherent target picture for data utilization must include the entire architecture, data platforms, infrastructure technologies and the project portfolio.Florian ThiegAssociate Partner, AdEx PartnersIdentified obstaclesThe challenges on the way to fully exploiting this potential are complex. Use cases that are developed from the bottom up or in a decentralized manner without taking existing organizational silos into account tend to be too ambitious. Another obstacle is the “120% approach”, which attempts to tackle everything at once and centrally, which regularly leads to excessive demands and suboptimal results. Another critical factor is the lack of dedicated topic or governance owners who take responsibility for specific areas and actively drive them forward. In addition, the lack of a link between user needs leads to isolated pilot projects with a diminishing marginal benefit curve over time – whether in the areas of robotics, mining or automation.Strategies for sustainable growthTo overcome these challenges, we at AdEx Partners propose a dual strategy that targets both top-line and bottom-line growth:Top-line growthThe key is to understand data as an integral part of services or products. The focus is always on the added value for the customer. Through value testing with clear objectives and measurable results, we can secure long-term attention and budget. An agile approach is essential in order to be able to react flexibly to changes in regulatory requirements and market conditions without sacrificing efficiency.Bottom-line supportFrom an internal perspective, data should be managed as an independent product. This includes the introduction of data ownership and stewardship. It is crucial to consider data as an integral part of services or products, for example to improve controllability or for simulations. The role of data must be considered in the design of every process. It is important to merge the value chain of data and processes – from analysis with mining to business process management (BPM) and automation, e.g. with software robotics.Practical example: Customer data base of a bankBanks generate an extensive database from customer interactions, transaction histories and market data. In order to use this data successfully and effectively, various analyses could be carried out in order to develop new products and services on this basis. There can be many reasons why this is not possible: Data is scattered across different departments, there is no uniform view of customer information or existing digital initiatives are not sufficiently coordinated.Dual solution approachOne approach to countering this could be twofold: improving the customer offering on the one hand(top-line growth)and optimizing internal processes on the other(bottom-line growth).To better integrate data into customer products, the bank could develop a new app that offers customers personalized financial advice based on their transaction behavior and financial goals. By using big data and AI, this app can provide individualized savings and investment recommendations tailored to the specific needs of each customer. On the one hand, this potentially increases customer satisfaction and loyalty and, on the other, can create a new source of income for the bank by recommending tailored financial products.In terms of data management as a standalone product, the bank could introduce a centralized data management system that brings together all customer data from different departments. This enables a unified view of customers and improves decision-making. The introduction of data governance and stewardship principles ensures that data quality and security remain at a high level. In addition, processes such as credit checks and risk analyses could be automated and thus made more efficient through the use of robotics and AI.As a result, by implementing a dual strategy, a bank can not only improve its services through data-driven personalization, but also optimize its internal processes. This holds considerable potential for cost savings while simultaneously increasing customer satisfaction. It could also increase cross-selling rates and improve operational efficiency. This practical example shows how the strategic use of data can not only help to solve existing problems, but also open up new growth opportunities for traditional financial institutions.ConclusionData is the new gold of the business world, but its potential is often left untapped.

This enables a unified view of customers and improves decision-making. The introduction of data governance and stewardship principles ensures that data quality and security remain at a high level. In addition, processes such as credit checks and risk analyses could be automated and thus made more efficient through the use of robotics and AI.\n\nOne approach to countering this could be twofold: improving the customer offering on the one hand(top-line growth)and optimizing internal processes on the other(bottom-line growth).\n\nFrom an internal perspective, data should be managed as an independent product. This includes the introduction of data ownership and stewardship. It is crucial to consider data as an integral part of services or products, for example to improve controllability or for simulations. The role of data must be considered in the design of every process. It is important to merge the value chain of data and processes – from analysis with mining to business process management (BPM) and automation, e.g. with software robotics.\n\nYet the ability to use data effectively is crucial to a company’s success. At AdEx Partners, we regularly find that much of this potential value remains untapped. Not due to a lack of data or technology, but rather due to an ineffective approach to its use. Our observations also show that digitalization initiatives are often launched as isolated projects that fail to reach their full potential due to a lack of a comprehensive strategy and integration into the overall business. A coherent target picture that includes the entire architecture, data platforms, infrastructure technologies and the project portfolio harbors enormous efficiency potential that often remains untapped.\n\nHome»Newsroom»Maximize your data treasure\n\nTop-line growthThe key is to understand data as an integral part of services or products. The focus is always on the added value for the customer. Through value testing with clear objectives and measurable results, we can secure long-term attention and budget. An agile approach is essential in order to be able to react flexibly to changes in regulatory requirements and market conditions without sacrificing efficiency.\n\nThe challenges on the way to fully exploiting this potential are complex. Use cases that are developed from the bottom up or in a decentralized manner without taking existing organizational silos into account tend to be too ambitious. Another obstacle is the “120% approach”, which attempts to tackle everything at once and centrally, which regularly leads to excessive demands and suboptimal results. Another critical factor is the lack of dedicated topic or governance owners who take responsibility for specific areas and actively drive them forward. In addition, the lack of a link between user needs leads to isolated pilot projects with a diminishing marginal benefit curve over time – whether in the areas of robotics, mining or automation.\n\nData is the new gold of the business world, but its potential is often left untapped.

In order to use this data successfully and effectively, various analyses could be carried out in order to develop new products and services on this basis.

By adopting a holistic approach, we aim to bring all facets of our operations in line with our strategic goals. This ensures that changes are well-coordinated, resources are optimized, and every part of the organization is contributing to the overall transformation. By doing this, we can achieve sustainable growth, improved efficiency, and a competitive edge in the industry.\n\nOrganization\n\nWhat is a holistic Target Operating Model (TOM)?A holistic Target Operating Model (TOM) is a comprehensive and integrated framework that outlines the entirety of an organization’s operations, processes, capabilities, and structure. It offers a strategic roadmap for how the organization will function in its desired future state, encompassing aspects such as people, processes, technology, culture, and governance. Unlike isolated solutions, a holistic TOM considers the interconnectedness of various components, ensuring that they work together synergistically to achieve the organization’s objectives.Why is it relevant?A holistic TOM is relevant because it provides a unified and strategic approach to organizational transformation and development. It aligns all aspects of the organization towards a common goal, fostering better coordination, improved efficiency, and enhanced performance. By addressing various dimensions of an organization’s functioning, it ensures that changes are not isolated or piecemeal but contribute to a coherent and successful transformation. This relevance extends to adapting to market changes, maximizing resources, and staying competitive in dynamic environments.Why are we doing this?We are implementing a holistic Target Operating Model (TOM) to facilitate a comprehensive and structured transformation within our organization.

By doing this, we can achieve sustainable growth, improved efficiency, and a competitive edge in the industry.What are the pain points?Without a holistic Target Operating Model (TOM), organizations often face several pain points during transformation initiatives. These include fragmented processes that hinder efficient operations, lack of alignment among different departments, and disjointed technology implementations that result in inefficiencies. Additionally, absence of a holistic approach can lead to resistance to change among employees, unclear accountability, and difficulties in measuring the success of transformation efforts. Addressing these pain points through a holistic TOM helps overcome these challenges and ensures a smoother, more successful transformation journey.\n\n25.

AdEx Partners helps organizations harness the power of agility. With expertise in enterprise agility, scaled agility, and team agility, we guide you toward a future-ready organization. We drive flexibility, adaptability, and continuous growth by integrating traditional and agile methodologies. Let us be your trusted advisor in navigating the journey toward organizational agility and driving value delivery in a changing world.Embracing Agility in a World full of Change and ComplexityIn an era characterized by swift technological advancements, shifting customer preferences, and unpredictable global events, businesses must adapt and flex to thrive. Agile methodologies offer the potential to leverage value delivery in such dynamic environments, focusing on people and adaptability. However, it’s crucial to understand that agile isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. It requires customization to fit your specific needs and align with your organization’s maturity.In today’s volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world, the traditional approach to business falls short. Agile, with its emphasis on adaptability and continuous improvement, provides the flexibility businesses need to navigate these uncertain times. It fosters a culture of teamwork and innovation, empowering businesses to react quickly and effectively to market changes.AdEx Partners can work jointly with your team to assess your current situation, design a target scenario, and guide you towards achieving it.

Traditional structures often struggle to keep pace with the fast-evolving landscape, leading to missed opportunities, decreased competitiveness, and a decline in business performance.In the conventional business world, companies often get ensnared in the complexities of waterfall project management, hierarchical structures, rigid work schedules, and intricate solution architectures. These factors can foster a silo mentality, create a web of dependencies, and result in long, inflexible lead times, leaving a workforce that’s task-focused, micromanaged, and ill-equipped to respond swiftly to market changes.Unpacking Agile:A Strategic Approach to Flexibility, Adaptability, and Value DeliveryAgile is more than just a buzzword.

It’s about integrating the best of both worlds—combining the stability of traditional structures with the flexibility of agile. By adopting lean portfolio management, organizing work around value, and working in small, frequent chunks, companies can reduce lead times and enhance employee satisfaction.When coupled with a modular, cloud-based architecture, this shift allows teams to innovate independently and respond quickly to market changes.

  "text": "18. June 2024\n\nLinkedIn\n\nIn business transformations, companies often focllow either a product- or customer-orientation. While these might be adequate at times, they neglect thepotential of a people-centric transformation.InPeople Centric Transformation, we acknowledge transformations focusing on people as a process entailing many aspects, such asemployee experience,happiness,engagement,performance, andbusiness outcomes. Our mission is to be your advisor through this holistic process and to ensure you do not lose sight of any of its aspects.A revolutionary perspective?Clients do not come first. Employees come first. If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients.Ricardo SemlerWhile product- and consumer-oriented transformations might seem more common, people-centric approaches are not as revolutionary as it may seem. People-centric transformation requires organizations to see people as their most valuable asset, but it does not mean that clients or products are neglected. Transformations with people at the center prioritize people as drivers for change in other areas, such as clients and product. People-centric transformation is the decision to realize a change with your people – not against them.Four essential steps to people centric successForming a transformation process around the people means putting special interest in their talents, needs and abilities. To align these with corporate strategy, our approach consists offour essential phases.Description of the dimensions1Strategy and missionTransformations do not happen overnight but need thorough preparation. A clear strategy and mission need to be formulated.2Pain points and action areasPain points and action areas need to be defined. Because transformations demand changes in the environment, it is important to gain knowledge about this environment, especially about the current situation of the purpose, leadership, and culture. After completing these steps, the transformation journey can begin and change can be implemented.3People-centric transformationThe people-centric transformation depends on the people being able to make the change. Therefore, challenging and demanding aspects and areas need to be identified and prepared. That way, people can be navigated successfully through the vast environment of a transformation. Only by knowing the people‘s needs, strengths and weeknesses and taking care of them, it can be assured that no one gets lost along the way!4ImplementThe transformation can begin! It is time to implement what has been prepared in the previous stages. Here, strategy and preparation will pay off!Improvement in these areas increasesemployeeexperienceandthereforealsoengagementwhich shows inhigherproductivity,qualityandloyaltyto the company.Engaged employeesare more willed to takeownershipandresponsibility.Committed employees are the key to improvedcustomer outcomesandbusiness success.Seen as the sum of many aspectsPeople Centric TransformationAt AdEx, we are confident that people centric transformation has to be seen as the sum of many aspects. It is a hollistic approach that, when followed correctly, has been proven to be successful. To lead a people-centric transformation to business success, the workplace environment with all ist aspects needs to be considered, people need to be provided with a feel-good factor to increase engagement. Employees who are engaged in their tasks, work more efficiently and productively, resulting in better outcomes for the customers who are satisfied and loyal to the company.We are certain that these aspects play a role in every transformation so that this process can be transferred to any case. As specialized advisors, we gladly navigate you through the process and help you lead your next transformation to success, with your valued employees on board.InsightsAdEx Partners Reaffirms Commitment to UNGC and SDGs25.

It is a hollistic approach that, when followed correctly, has been proven to be successful. To lead a people-centric transformation to business success, the workplace environment with all ist aspects needs to be considered, people need to be provided with a feel-good factor to increase engagement. Employees who are engaged in their tasks, work more efficiently and productively, resulting in better outcomes for the customers who are satisfied and loyal to the company.\n\nImprovement in these areas increasesemployeeexperienceandthereforealsoengagementwhich shows inhigherproductivity,qualityandloyaltyto the company.\n\nWhile product- and consumer-oriented transformations might seem more common, people-centric approaches are not as revolutionary as it may seem. People-centric transformation requires organizations to see people as their most valuable asset, but it does not mean that clients or products are neglected. Transformations with people at the center prioritize people as drivers for change in other areas, such as clients and product. People-centric transformation is the decision to realize a change with your people – not against them.\n\n2Pain points and action areasPain points and action areas need to be defined. Because transformations demand changes in the environment, it is important to gain knowledge about this environment, especially about the current situation of the purpose, leadership, and culture. After completing these steps, the transformation journey can begin and change can be implemented.\n\nquality\n\n25.

Employees’ individual personal challenges and qualities are inevitably part of the organization’s ecosystem and will finally hinder or boost the overall business performance. Knowing how to manage and improve these factors is crucial in the modern business world.We consider the individual personality and given environment to achieve optimal performance on individual, team and even company level. Given the right circumstances, individual and teams can be enabled to reach high performance levels. For us, investing in people is not a burden but the competitive advantage in todays’ challenging world.Well-Being is the gamechanger for your businessWell-Being is a complex system that cannot be solved with a one-size-fits-all solution. As trusted advisors we offer a holistic assessment and finding the best solutions for your employees and teams.In our assessment we concentrate on three factors that make up the basis for optimal performance:Personality,Body andMind.

As your trusted advisor, we guide you through the process and provide the according tool.No Performance without Well-BeingWith an increasing body of studies around the topic well-being emerging, it becomes clear that well-being is important to employees, it is crucial for performance and it needs to be a top priority for business.74 %of employees with a thriving well-being are told to be top-performers by their managers62 %of employees with low well-being are actively searching for a new job75 %of employees mention well-being in one of their top prioritiesWell-Being: More than just a trendLacking well-being among employees can be the underlying issue behind what is encountered as the big problem. Measures to increase well-being can, therefore, be the answer to your problems.Studies show a major gap between C-suite perception and employee assessement of the employee well-being status. Because of this gap, it has proven highly beneficial to map the acutal well-being through a neutral assessment that lays the necessary basis to analyze and enhance the acutal well-being. We, as trusted advisors, can help you assess the actual well-being of your staff, understand the underlying issues, identify neccessary levers and ultimately improve overall well-being and performance.How to: Well-BeingEnhancing well-being demands an individual approach because lives are individually different but also because a one-fits-all approach is not applicable.

The processes that generate it or are managed with it and the insights gained from its evaluation and analysis are the basis and value driver of every business model. At AdEx Partners, I am responsible for the portfolio area ofData Value Managementand thus help our clients with all issues related todata and business processes: from data governance and business process management to business intelligence, analytics and data science as well as applications such as artificial intelligence, process mining and robotic process automation.For me, Data Value Management is not just an IT topic, but essential for the entire company. Across industries, I support the management level of our clients in taking responsibility for their data, working consciously with it and thus creating the greatest possible value for the company. The basis for this is a comprehensive data strategy as well as the establishment or expansion of holisticdata governancewith the right tools for an integrated IT landscape. Essential for my work is on the one hand the further development of the business model of my clients and on the other hand the empowerment and motivation of the employees who work with the data.I started my consulting career in 1999 at PwC Consulting with a focus on SAP R/3, later moving to Accenture where I was able to broaden mySAP knowledgeand gain experience as aproject managerin largetransformation projects, including in the UK, Switzerland and Singapore. With the desire to also get to know “the other side” of the business, in 2012 I moved to a large family-owned company in the travel retail sector in Hamburg. The experiences from this time help me – since 2016 at AdEx Partners again as a consultant – to better understand the perspective of my customers, their challenges and motivations, to jointly find sustainable solutions at eye level.During my studies in industrial engineering at the Helmut Schmidt University of the German Armed Forces in Hamburg and my subsequent work as an officer, I already worked on the intersection between business and technical topics and learned that even the best technology is only as good as the people and the organization that uses it. In my diploma thesis on integrated mobility concepts, I dealt with data and its value-adding use in networked systems for the first time. This is a topic that has stuck with me ever since and that I now drive forward with a great deal of commitment together with my customers.I live with my family in Hamburg, enjoy traveling and sailing, and ride my gravel bike as often as I can.

The processes that generate it or are managed with it and the insights gained from its evaluation and analysis are the basis and value driver of every business model. At AdEx Partners, I am responsible for the portfolio area ofData Value Managementand thus help our clients with all issues related todata and business processes: from data governance and business process management to business intelligence, analytics and data science as well as applications such as artificial intelligence, process mining and robotic process automation.For me, Data Value Management is not just an IT topic, but essential for the entire company. Across industries, I support the management level of our clients in taking responsibility for their data, working consciously with it and thus creating the greatest possible value for the company. The basis for this is a comprehensive data strategy as well as the establishment or expansion of holisticdata governancewith the right tools for an integrated IT landscape. Essential for my work is on the one hand the further development of the business model of my clients and on the other hand the empowerment and motivation of the employees who work with the data.I started my consulting career in 1999 at PwC Consulting with a focus on SAP R/3, later moving to Accenture where I was able to broaden mySAP knowledgeand gain experience as aproject managerin largetransformation projects, including in the UK, Switzerland and Singapore. With the desire to also get to know “the other side” of the business, in 2012 I moved to a large family-owned company in the travel retail sector in Hamburg. The experiences from this time help me – since 2016 at AdEx Partners again as a consultant – to better understand the perspective of my customers, their challenges and motivations, to jointly find sustainable solutions at eye level.During my studies in industrial engineering at the Helmut Schmidt University of the German Armed Forces in Hamburg and my subsequent work as an officer, I already worked on the intersection between business and technical topics and learned that even the best technology is only as good as the people and the organization that uses it.

By using digital tools, a strategy can be developed both, bottom-up and top-down and communicated efficiently. This enables a quick and efficient start to the subsequentbusiness transformation.For project and program management of large transformations, a structured approach is just as important as a sense for the interpersonal. As a leader of various international projects and large programs, I structure the strategic goals, organization, agile ways of working and reporting with proven methods such as Design Thinking, Scaled Agile Frameworks, MVP approaches, and more.For the success of abusiness strategyand the associatedtransformationin a VUCA world, both standardized approaches and creativity are needed. I often act as a translator between the business and IT world.A good example of this are the challenges ofstrategic company acquisitionsand carve-outs. A very flourishing private equity market and the pressure to quickly occupy digital business areas has led to a steady increase in the number ofM&A activities. Thus the success of M&A activities is therefore even more dependent on the right strategy to gain a competitive advantage. A fast identification of synergies and agile approaches in the implementation are critical for success.

As aproject and program managerfor large transformation projects, I take responsibility for successfully shaping the implementation by system integrators alongside our customers.After a start at Accenture as an enterprise IT architect and integration expert, I have been focusing on CRM and Customer Centricity topics since 2010.

This can lead to investor uncertainty and affect confidence in the financial system.Terrorism and cybercrime:The increasing threat of terrorist activities and cyberattacks may also have an impact on European banks. Cyberattacks can lead to the theft of data and information, which can undermine customers’ trust in banks.Sanctions and trade wars:The intensification of sanctions and trade wars may lead to an increase in geopolitical risks, which may have a negative impact on the economy and financial markets. This may lead to a decrease in trade volumes and an increase in credit risks.Rapidly rising interest rates:The rapid rise in market interest rates can put institutions in a tight spot. In the past, financial institutions granted long-term loans at low interest rates and now have to pay significantly more for their refinancing.Ukraine war:For banks, a loss of customers in particularly affected economic sectors is difficult to assess. Exposures to customers with close business ties to Russia or Ukraine need to be reviewed. However, customers who have already been significantly affected by the pandemic may also pose an increased risk.The right answers in times of political and economic uncertaintyCompetition from fintech startups:The emerging fintech companies offer innovative and convenient solutions for banking services. This can lead to traditional banks losing customers to these new providers.Cyber security:Advancing digitalization increases the risk of cyber attacks on banks and their customers. Banks must ensure that they have sufficient protective mechanisms in place to minimize this threat.Changes in customer behavior:Today’s customers expect a seamless experience when it comes to banking services. They are willing to switch to mobile solutions and use online banking. Banks need to ensure they can meet these expectations to remain competitive.Regulatory requirements:Technological change also has an impact on the regulatory requirements for banks. Banks must ensure that they meet these requirements and adapt their processes accordingly.Legacy systems:Many banks have outdated systems that make it difficult to adapt to changing technology. However, updating these systems can create another challenge for banks.Withstanding competition and making the right decisions in times of changeRapidly rising interest rates:The rapid rise in market interest rates can put institutions in a tight spot. In the past, financial institutions granted long-term loans at low interest rates and now have to pay significantly more for their refinancing.Digital transformation:Digitization has led to new, technology-based competitors such as Fintechs and BigTechs entering the market and putting established banks under pressure. Banks must therefore adapt their business models and processes to remain competitive.Regulation:Banking regulation in Europe is very complex and extensive, which is a challenge for smaller banks in particular. They have to allocate additional resources to compliance and risk management, which can affect their competitiveness.Geopolitical uncertainties:Geopolitical tensions, trade conflicts and political unrest can affect economic stability and thus impact banks’ business.Demographic change:The European population is aging, leading to a change in demand for financial products. Banks must adapt their offerings accordingly to meet the needs of the older population.Addressing change with the right professionalsRecruiting skilled workers:One of the biggest challenges facing European banks is finding and recruiting qualified skilled workers. Highly qualified employees are scarce, especially in the areas of technology and digitalization. It is difficult to find applicants with the right skills and experience and to poach them from competitors.Competitiveness:The shortage of skilled workers can affect banks’ competitiveness. If they are unable to attract the right talent, they may struggle to compete with other banks and FinTech companies that have a talented workforce.Cost:Hiring and retaining skilled professionals can be expensive. Banks may need to offer higher salaries and benefits to attract and retain talent. This can increase costs for the bank and affect its profitability.Risks:Skilled labor shortages can also increase the risk of errors and fraud. When banks do not have enough skilled employees to adequately perform all tasks and responsibilities, errors and risks can occur that can lead to financial losses.Innovation:Hiring talent is critical to banks’ ability to innovate. If they do not have the right talent, they may struggle to develop new products and services and innovate business models to keep pace with the rapidly changing needs of customers.\n\nYour contact personsRené-Michel JostZum ProfilLinkedInBjörn RösnerZum ProfilLinkedInMatthias StollerZum ProfilLinkedInPhilipp VüllersZum ProfilLinkedInTanja HerzigZum ProfilLinkedInOliver StrabergerZum ProfilLinkedInMarco WeberZum ProfilLinkedInJochen BergZum ProfilLinkedInDr. Anton SchäferZum ProfilLinkedInJörg StefanZum ProfilLinkedIn\n\n25.

However, only very few established banks and financial service providers have tackled such a holistic approach so far.The 5 Hot Topics for European Banks and Financial Service ProvidersRegulatoryUncertain geopolitical environmentTechnological changeCompetitive pressureSkills shortageExpand processes while keeping an eye on regulatory requirementsImplementation of DORA, Basel IV & Co.:DORA is intended to increase the resilience of financial companies to IT-related risks, Basel IV is to further tighten capital requirements and introduce stricter rules for the risk assessment of credit portfolios.Climate change risk assessment:regulators are expected to increase climate change risk disclosure requirements to ensure that banks understand and respond appropriately to their climate change risks.Digital Identity:regulators could encourage the adoption of Digital Identities to increase security in online transactions and prevent fraud.Monitoring BigTech companies:regulators could increase oversight of BigTech companies that provide financial services to ensure they meet the same regulatory standards as traditional banks.Data protection:it is likely that data protection will remain an important regulatory focus in the future as consumer concerns about the protection of their data continue to grow.The right answers in times of political and economic uncertaintyPolitical uncertainty:The political changes and instabilities in many countries may jeopardize the stability of the financial system and have a negative impact on the financial markets. This can lead to investor uncertainty and affect confidence in the financial system.Terrorism and cybercrime:The increasing threat of terrorist activities and cyberattacks may also have an impact on European banks. Cyberattacks can lead to the theft of data and information, which can undermine customers’ trust in banks.Sanctions and trade wars:The intensification of sanctions and trade wars may lead to an increase in geopolitical risks, which may have a negative impact on the economy and financial markets. This may lead to a decrease in trade volumes and an increase in credit risks.Rapidly rising interest rates:The rapid rise in market interest rates can put institutions in a tight spot. In the past, financial institutions granted long-term loans at low interest rates and now have to pay significantly more for their refinancing.Ukraine war:For banks, a loss of customers in particularly affected economic sectors is difficult to assess. Exposures to customers with close business ties to Russia or Ukraine need to be reviewed. However, customers who have already been significantly affected by the pandemic may also pose an increased risk.The right answers in times of political and economic uncertaintyCompetition from fintech startups:The emerging fintech companies offer innovative and convenient solutions for banking services. This can lead to traditional banks losing customers to these new providers.Cyber security:Advancing digitalization increases the risk of cyber attacks on banks and their customers. Banks must ensure that they have sufficient protective mechanisms in place to minimize this threat.Changes in customer behavior:Today’s customers expect a seamless experience when it comes to banking services. They are willing to switch to mobile solutions and use online banking. Banks need to ensure they can meet these expectations to remain competitive.Regulatory requirements:Technological change also has an impact on the regulatory requirements for banks. Banks must ensure that they meet these requirements and adapt their processes accordingly.Legacy systems:Many banks have outdated systems that make it difficult to adapt to changing technology. However, updating these systems can create another challenge for banks.Withstanding competition and making the right decisions in times of changeRapidly rising interest rates:The rapid rise in market interest rates can put institutions in a tight spot. In the past, financial institutions granted long-term loans at low interest rates and now have to pay significantly more for their refinancing.Digital transformation:Digitization has led to new, technology-based competitors such as Fintechs and BigTechs entering the market and putting established banks under pressure. Banks must therefore adapt their business models and processes to remain competitive.Regulation:Banking regulation in Europe is very complex and extensive, which is a challenge for smaller banks in particular. They have to allocate additional resources to compliance and risk management, which can affect their competitiveness.Geopolitical uncertainties:Geopolitical tensions, trade conflicts and political unrest can affect economic stability and thus impact banks’ business.Demographic change:The European population is aging, leading to a change in demand for financial products. Banks must adapt their offerings accordingly to meet the needs of the older population.Addressing change with the right professionalsRecruiting skilled workers:One of the biggest challenges facing European banks is finding and recruiting qualified skilled workers. Highly qualified employees are scarce, especially in the areas of technology and digitalization. It is difficult to find applicants with the right skills and experience and to poach them from competitors.Competitiveness:The shortage of skilled workers can affect banks’ competitiveness. If they are unable to attract the right talent, they may struggle to compete with other banks and FinTech companies that have a talented workforce.Cost:Hiring and retaining skilled professionals can be expensive. Banks may need to offer higher salaries and benefits to attract and retain talent. This can increase costs for the bank and affect its profitability.Risks:Skilled labor shortages can also increase the risk of errors and fraud. When banks do not have enough skilled employees to adequately perform all tasks and responsibilities, errors and risks can occur that can lead to financial losses.Innovation:Hiring talent is critical to banks’ ability to innovate. If they do not have the right talent, they may struggle to develop new products and services and innovate business models to keep pace with the rapidly changing needs of customers.InsightsAdEx Partners Reaffirms Commitment to UNGC and SDGs25.

Bewertung und Priorisierung der relevanten Veränderungen\n\nDigital FinanceSteigender Kapitalmarktdruck, neue Kundenanforderungen, Verschärfungen des gesetzlichen Regelwerks oder auch der Wandel der Unternehmensstrukturen sind nur einige der Faktoren, die den Finance-Bereich zu Veränderungen zwingen. Der Veränderungsdruck hat aber auch etwas Positives:In der Transformation des Finanzressorts steckt massives Potenzial zur Steigerung der Effizienz und Effektivität.Der disruptive Change des Finanzbereichs mit innovativer Technik und neuen Strukturen ermöglicht mehr Transparenz, Agilität und Handlungsspielraum – aber nur, wenn die Strategie dementsprechend ausgerichtet ist und flexible Finanzbetriebsmodelle sowie eine sinnvoll priorisierte Roadmap vorgibt.Die Notwendigkeit in einen Erfolgsfaktor wandelnMit der Finance Transformation, also der Digitalisierung des Finanzbereichs, wird einhöherer Automatisierungsgraderreicht undvorausschauende Transparenzermöglicht. Ziel ist die Entwicklung eines leistungsfähigen Betriebsmodells, die Verbesserung der Kernprozesse, eine Senkung des Kostenniveaus, eine Zeitersparnis, die Erhöhung der Datenqualität und damit einhergehend signifikant verbesserte Möglichkeiten für das Controlling und die Finanzberichterstattung.Besonders der Finanzbereich muss sich zukünftig fragen, welchen Wertbeitrag er als Geschäftsbereich in einer digitalen Zukunft leisten kann und wie er sich die neuen Möglichkeiten sinnvoll zunutze macht. Denn eins steht fest:Finance muss reagieren, um einflussreich zu bleiben.Wie wirkt sich der Fortschritt in der digitalen Landschaft auf den Finance-Bereich aus?Das Aufgabenfeld im Finanzwesen wird zukünftig immer weniger von repetitiven und transnationalen Tätigkeiten geprägt sein und hin zu mehr Analysen und intelligenten Auswertungen von internen und externen Datenquellen (Business Intelligence und Advanced Analytics) transferieren.Die entsprechende Technologie schafft vollständige Transparenz, robuste digitale Sicherheit und unbestreitbares Vertrauen. Kognitive Netzwerke und KI lösen komplexe Probleme schneller und genauer als jeder Mensch. Finance kann Daten aus beliebigen Quellen in unbegrenzten Mengen verarbeiten und zuverlässig die effektivsten Geschäftsergebnisse vorhersagen.Neben den Ansprüchen an die Technologieändern sich auch die fachlichen Anforderungen in immer kürzeren Zyklen. Sowohl die Organisation als auch die Fähigkeiten der Mitarbeiter müssen darauf ausgereichtet undassistiert weiterentwickeltwerden.Mit unserer bereichsübergreifenden Erfahrung bei der Digitalen Transformation und spezieller Fachexpertise im Finanzressort entwickeln wir mit Ihnen gemeinsam eine Strategie für Ihre Finance Transformation als disruptiven Prozess.

Zentraler Dreh- und Angelpunkt für digitalisierte, zukunftsfähige Geschäftsstrukturen ist die IT.War die IT bisher eher ein operative Service-Einheit mit Fokus auf die verlässliche Bereitstellung von IT Dienstleistungenentwickelt sie sich nunmehr zunehmend zu einem integralen Bestandteil der Wertschöpfung der Unternehmen. Digitale Plattformen, Digitalisierung von Produkten und Servicenageboten und nicht zuletzt auch Abhängigkeit effizienter Geschäfts- und Kundenprozesse von Informationen und Technologie machen die IT zu einem Kernfaktor unternehmerischen Erfolges.Die Transformation der IT ist also weit mehr als die Beantwortung der Frage, wie neue Technologien in bestehende Architekturen integriert werden können. Neue Methoden sind notwendig und müssen im Unternehmen gelebt, gelernt und erlebt werden können. Bestehende Arbeitsmodelle müssen im Kontext der Verschmelzung von IT und Geschäftsbereichen neu gedacht werden. Agile endkundenfokussierte Entwicklung, kontinuierliche Änderung (CI/ CD), adaptive Skalierung unter Nutzung von Hyperscalern, Sicherung digitaler Sicherheit bis hin zur umfassenden Transformation des IT Operating Modells  hin zu produktorientierte Aufstellung und gemeinsamen Value Streams mit den Geschäftsbereichen sind nur einige der Herausforderungen, die moderne IT Organisation bewältigen müssen. Und nicht zu vergessen: die Mitarbeiter. Sie gestalten die Veränderung, müssen sie verstehen und mittragen.Mit Automation und Disruption der hohen Veränderungsgeschwindigkeit begegnen.IT-Transformationen sind komplex. Veränderungen wirken sich meist auf sämtliche Geschäftsbereiche aus und beeinflussen die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit des Unternehmens. Die technologische Disruption und die Anpassung der internen IT, um auf aktuelle, absehbare und noch nicht bekannte Erfordernisse reagieren zu können, als fortwährenden Prozess zu etablieren, ist die Hauptanforderung an entsprechende Transformationsvorhaben. Im Grunde geht es also darum,die IT als inhärenten Bestandteil der Wertschöpfung zu begreifenund derart wandlungsfähig aufzustellen, dass sie Treiber digitaler Transformation des ganzen Unternehmens ist.Veränderungen in der IT-Organisation werden oft punktuell und ohne Gesamtblick auf das Unternehmen vorgenommen – vielfach führen diese dann nicht zum gewünschten Ergebnis. In Unkenntnis ihrer Leistungsfähigkeit und der steigenden Geschäftsanforderungen wird die IT nicht zielgerichtet gesteuert. Daraus resultieren Leistungen, die von den Fachbereichen als nicht ausreichend oder als wenig unterstützend angesehen werden.Mit unserer Erfahrung aus vielzähligen Transformationsprojekten, umfangreichem Technologiewissen und der pragmatischen Herangehensweise unterstützen wir Sie von derDefinition der neuen strategischen Richtung bis hin zur Umsetzung.

Dieser ist sie jedoch nicht immer gewachsen, wird als Risiko – Cyber Security -, Engpass – Ressourcenknappheit und Lieferfähigkeit – oder als Innovationshemmnis – Cloud, AI und digitale Plattformen – wahrgenommen.\n\nKontaktformular\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\",(function(){var e=document.getElementById(\"cf-turnstile-fluent-61493662\");e&&!e.innerHTML.trim()&&(turnstile.remove(\"#cf-turnstile-fluent-61493662\"),turnstile.render(\"#cf-turnstile-fluent-61493662\",{sitekey:\"0x4AAAAAAAfQsGhXnAOpIs2I\"}))}));",
